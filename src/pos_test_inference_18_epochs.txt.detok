Only when the expression level of ectopic reelin in the BR1 became very weak were sympathetic preganglionic neurons found to cluster near the BR2. learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between reelin and sympathetic preganglionic neurons exists.
The p75 null-mutant and wild type litter mate mice were assessed for central cholinergic deficit by using quantitative stereology to estimate the total neuronal number in BR1 and BR2 and for subpopulations expressing the high-affinity tyrosine receptor kinase A neurotrophin receptor and choline acetyltransferase. learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between BR1 and BR2 exists.
Tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive elements in the human BR1 and BR2. learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between BR1 and BR2 exists.

Our results suggest enkephalin fibers in BR1 are of both supraspinal and intraspinal origin, whereas the enkephalin innervation of the BR2 is primarily intraspinal in origin. learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between BR1 and BR2 exists.
We have reevaluated the outgrowth of fetal rat BR1 / AH grafts implanted in the BR2 of hamsters by using two methods: the carbocyanine dye, 1,1'dioctadecyl-3,3 '-tetramethylindocarbocyanine percholate, was placed directly onto grafted tissue; and a donor-specific neurofilament marker was used in conjunction with xenografts. learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between BR1 / AH and BR2 exists.
