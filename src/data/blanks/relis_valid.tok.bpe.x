Vie@@ w@@ ed broadly , BR@@ 1 posterior division cell groups share massive , top@@ ographically organized , bidirectional connections with the BR@@ 2 and other amygdal@@ ar components of the accessory olfactory system ( D@@ ong et al , 200@@ 1a ; D@@ ong and Sw@@ an@@ son , 200@@ 4b ) , and they send massive , topographic projections to components of the hypothalamic behavior control column that are associated with the two basic classes of social behavior : reproductive and defensive ( D@@ ong and Sw@@ an@@ son , 200@@ 4b ) .
In contrast , the BR@@ 1 anterolateral group receives massive inputs from the BR@@ 2 and main olfactory system components of the amygdala ( D@@ ong et al , 200@@ 1a ) and s@@ ends dense projections to the central autonomic control network , to midbrain structures positioned to modulate the expression of orofacial and locomotor somat@@ omotor responses , and to regions of the ventral stri@@ at@@ op@@ all@@ idal system associated with these midbrain struc@@ - B@@ ST@@ d@@ m PRO@@ JEC@@ TIONS tures ( D@@ ong et al , 2000 , 200@@ 1b , 2003 , 200@@ 4a ) .
The BR@@ 1 lies just ventral to the anterior commissure , between the undifferentiated BR@@ 2 anter@@ omedial area ( B@@ ST@@ am ) and the lateral edge of the medial preoptic area .

The B@@ ST@@ d@@ m lies just ventral to the anterior commissure , between the undifferentiated B@@ ST anter@@ omedial area ( BR@@ 1 ) and the lateral edge of the BR@@ 2 .
As shown here , the axonal projections of the BR@@ 1 also differ from those of other BR@@ 2 anterior division components .
&quot; RESULTS N@@ omenclature The BR@@ 1 was described originally as a &quot; &quot; loosely arranged , relatively ill @-@ defined nucleus that partly envel@@ ops the lateral aspect of the BR@@ 2 &quot; &quot; ( J@@ u and Sw@@ an@@ son , 1989 ) , and no unique , distinguishing , chemo@@ architec@@ tonic features were identified at the time ( J@@ u et al , 1989 ) . &quot;
Our PH@@ AL analysis of BR@@ 1 connections , accompanied by a great deal more cyto@@ architec@@ tonic examination in over 200 brains , provides the basis for proposing a revised definition of BR@@ 2 boundaries .
First , the rostral tongue of the original BR@@ 1 ( atlas levels 16 19 ; Sw@@ an@@ son , 1998 1999 ) is assigned to the BR@@ 2 .
It is based on observations that PH@@ AL injections involving the rostral tongue of the original BR@@ 1 , but not its caudal end , do not label the projection pattern described below but instead label the pattern characteristic for the BR@@ 2 ( see experiments B@@ ST@@ 13 , 114 , and 134 illustrated in D@@ ong and Sw@@ an@@ son , 200@@ 4b ) .
Second , the caudal end of the original BR@@ 1 dorsolateral nucleus ( atlas levels 21 ; Sw@@ an@@ son , 1998 1999 ) is now assigned to the BR@@ 2 , based on the evidence provided by injection sites illustrated in Figure 1 .
Adult male Har@@ l@@ an Sprague @-@ Dawley rats ( 300 350 g ) received a single , stere@@ otax@@ ically placed iontoph@@ oretic injection of a 2 . 5 % solution of PH@@ AL ( Vector Laboratories , Bur@@ ling@@ ame , BR@@ 1 ) , prepared in 0 . 1 M sodium phosphate @-@ buffered saline ( Na@@ PBS ) , pH 7 . 4 , into various regions of the BR@@ 2 through a glass micro@@ pipette ( 15 m tip diameter ) by applying a positive current ( 5 A , 7 @-@ second on / off intervals ) for 7@@ 10 minutes .
Bra@@ ins were Injection sites In our collection of PH@@ AL experiments involving the BR@@ 1 , only three injection sites ( experiments B@@ ST@@ 116 , 148 , and 155 ) are centered in the BR@@ 2 as defined here , and none is confined entirely within its borders ( Fig 1 ) .

In addition , the dendrites of neurons in adjacent cell groups ( eg , the BR@@ 1 BR@@ 2 ; D@@ ong and Sw@@ an@@ son , 200@@ 5a ) can extend into the B@@ ST@@ d@@ m , and it is well known that PH@@ AL is avid@@ ly incorporated by dendrites ( Ger@@ fen and S@@ aw@@ chen@@ ko , 1984 ) .

Finally , many axons from the BR@@ 1 injection site extend caud@@ ally into the BR@@ 2 posterior division , where moderate numbers of fibers with boutons are observed in the inter@@ fasc@@ icular nucleus and ventral region of the transverse nucleus ; the principal nucleus contains only scattered fibers ( Fig 4@@ J ) .
Many of these fibers continue on into the BR@@ 1 , rostral end of the BR@@ 2 , and medial preoptic area , where they join the medial forebrain bundle or the ventral and lateral propri@@ o@@ hypothalamic pathways ( see next section ) .

In the B@@ ST anterior division , the BR@@ 1 moderately to densely innerv@@ ates the BR@@ 2 and caud@@ o@@ ventral region of the anterolateral area and the fusiform , rhom@@ boid , and ventral nuclei , whereas the rostral two @-@ thirds of the anterolateral area and the caud@@ odorsal end of the anter@@ omedial area , along with the oval and jux@@ tac@@ apsular nuclei , receive only sparse inputs at best In the B@@ ST posterior division , only the inter@@ fasc@@ icular nucleus and ventral regions of the transverse nucleus receive significant inputs from the B@@ ST@@ d@@ m

Small numbers of fibers and terminals are also found in the BR@@ 1 , anter@@ odorsal part of the me@@ - BR@@ 2 PRO@@ JEC@@ TIONS dial nucleus , and anterior bas@@ omedial nucleus ( Fig 4@@ LP ) .

The pattern of BR@@ 1 inputs to the BR@@ 2 is exceptionally complex and is unique .
Many PH@@ AL @-@ labeled axons from the BR@@ 1 injection site extend dorsome@@ di@@ ally into the BR@@ 2 , ventral to the crossing of the anterior commissure ( Fig 4H , I ) , before ascending and descending to innervate a variety of structures in the hypothalamic periventricular region of Th@@ omp@@ son and Sw@@ an@@ son ( 2003 ) .

Many PH@@ AL @-@ labeled axons from the B@@ ST@@ d@@ m injection site extend dorsome@@ di@@ ally into the BR@@ 1 , ventral to the crossing of the anterior commissure ( Fig 4H , I ) , before ascending and descending to innervate a variety of structures in the hypothalamic BR@@ 2 of Th@@ omp@@ son and Sw@@ an@@ son ( 2003 ) .
Other fibers in the BR@@ 1 extend dor@@ s@@ ally and caud@@ ally , eventually to enter the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ HK ) , where they branch infrequently but generate abundant boutons , especially peripherally ( Fig@@ s 4@@ J , K , 6@@ E ) .
Based on our collection of over 200 PH@@ AL experiments , the den@@ s@@ est BR@@ 1 input to the paraventricular magnocellular neuroendocrine division arises in the BR@@ 2 .
Many periventricular fibers also course through and generate branches and boutons in the BR@@ 1 ( Fig 4@@ LO ) , and some continue into the dorsomedial nucleus ( Fig 4@@ PR ) , although most in- 83 puts to the latter appear to enter via the BR@@ 2 .
As mentioned above , abundant PH@@ AL @-@ labeled BR@@ 1 axons enter the BR@@ 2 and join the ventral propri@@ o@@ hypothalamic pathway as defined by Th@@ omp@@ son and Sw@@ an@@ son ( 2003 ; Fig 4H , I ) .
Initially , they generate extremely dense branches and boutons in the BR@@ 1 and adjacent rostral pole of the BR@@ 2 ( Fig@@ s 4@@ HK , 5B ) .
Many axons also extend medi@@ ally to generate a moderate input to the lateral part of the BR@@ 1 ( Fig@@ s 4@@ H@@ J , 5B ) , as well as dor@@ s@@ ally to innervate the BR@@ 2 , jux@@ tap@@ ar@@ av@@ entricular region ( Fig 4@@ K@@ N ) .
Asc@@ ending fibers course through the medial preoptic area , generating numerous branches and boutons in the medial preoptic area and two cell groups embedded within it : the BR@@ 1 and rostral tip of the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ DH ) .
Many of them join the pathway after traveling through ( and innervating ) the BR@@ 1 and immediately adjacent regions of the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ LN ) .
Many axons here resemble fibers of passage , although considerable boutons of passage nevertheless are present , so that distinct terminal fields are present in ventral regions of the BR@@ 1 ventral to the fornix , specifically in the intermediate BR@@ 2 , and in the jux@@ ta@@ ventromedial region ( ventral zone ) and sub@@ for@@ n@@ ical region ( posterior zone ; Fig 4@@ PS ) .
At preoptic and anterior hypothalamic levels , fibers extend laterally , dorsal to the BR@@ 1 , to innervate the BR@@ 2 ( Fig@@ s 4@@ HN , 8A , B ) .
Many fibers also generate terminals in the anterior region ( ventral zone ) of the BR@@ 1 , immediately dorsal to the BR@@ 2 ( Fig@@ s 4@@ IM , 8A , B ) .
More caud@@ ally , laterally directed axons with branches and boutons extend through and to ventral regions of the BR@@ 1 near the BR@@ 2 , eventually to reach the amygdal@@ ar region ( Fig 4@@ NP ) .
At anterior hypothalamic levels , many fibers in the ventral path turn medi@@ ally to branch and generate boutons in seemingly undifferentiated regions of the BR@@ 1 surrounding the rostral end of the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ I , J ) , and some fibers even enter Fig 4 .
More caud@@ ally , many axons generate branches and terminal boutons in the BR@@ 1 ( Fig 4@@ L , M ) , and some extend medi@@ ally through the supraoptic commissure system to the contralateral side of the brain , where they provide scattered fibers in the BR@@ 2 and distinct terminal fields in the supraoptic nucleus ( Fig 4@@ L , M ) .
More caud@@ ally , many axons generate branches and terminal boutons in the BR@@ 1 ( Fig 4@@ L , M ) , and some extend medi@@ ally through the supraoptic commissure system to the contralateral side of the brain , where they provide scattered fibers in the anterior hypothalamic nucleus and distinct terminal fields in the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ L , M ) .
More caud@@ ally , many axons generate branches and terminal boutons in the retro@@ chi@@ asmatic area ( Fig 4@@ L , M ) , and some extend medi@@ ally through the supraoptic commissure system to the contralateral side of the brain , where they provide scattered fibers in the BR@@ 1 and distinct terminal fields in the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ L , M ) .
Other distinct BR@@ 1 terminal fields are observed in certain readily identifiable clusters of the accessory BR@@ 2 , particularly near blood vessels in regions dorsal to and even within the optic tract ( see Fig 8@@ C ; Pe@@ ter@@ son , 1966 ; Du@@ an and J@@ u , 1998 ; K@@ han et al , 1999 ) .

Just caudal to the paraventricular nucleus , BR@@ 1 fibers generate an extremely dense terminal plexus in the supra@@ for@@ n@@ ical region of the BR@@ 2 , between the zona inc@@ er@@ ta and fornix ( Fig@@ s 4@@ PR , 9@@ A ) .
Near the caudal end of the ventromedial nucleus , some PH@@ AL @-@ labeled axons leave the BR@@ 1 to enter and very densely innervate the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ Q@@ U ) .
Rem@@ aining axons in this dorsal branch either extend far@@ ther dor@@ s@@ ally into the BR@@ 1 ( Fig 4@@ Q@@ U ) or arch caud@@ ally into the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4V ) .
Ax@@ ons in the BR@@ 1 proper continue caud@@ ally in the posterior region of the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4T , U ) , where they branch occasionally and generate a few boutons but tend to avoid the 94 H @-@ W D@@ ON@@ G AND LW SW@@ AN@@ SON Fig 7 .

Throughout their descending course through the BR@@ 1 , some fibers arch medi@@ ally and then dor@@ s@@ ally into the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ J@@ U ) .
These fibers tend to extend caud@@ ally in the dorsal periventricular bundle centered in the paraventricular nucleus , a course taken by axons from other BR@@ 1 cell groups ( such as the BR@@ 2 ; D@@ ong and Sw@@ an@@ son , 2003 ) .
All along anterior and tub@@ eral hypothalamic levels , scattered fibers leave the BR@@ 1 to arch medi@@ ally through the zona inc@@ er@@ ta and then more caud@@ ally through the BR@@ 2 to enter the midline thalamic nuclei ( Fig 4@@ LR ) .
However , the largest numbers of medi@@ odor@@ s@@ ally arching fibers leave the BR@@ 1 at the level of the 96 H @-@ W D@@ ON@@ G AND LW SW@@ AN@@ SON Figure 7 ( Continued ) caudal one @-@ third of the paraventricular thalamic nucleus , arching initially through the BR@@ 2 ( which is heavily innervated ; see above ) and then through the central medial and intermedi@@ odorsal nuclei to end in caudal regions of the paraventricular nucleus ( Fig 4@@ SU ) .

These axons extend from the posterior region of the BR@@ 1 into the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4V , W ) , where they branch infrequently but generate many boutons to provide a relatively moderate input ( Fig 4@@ W@@ Y ) .
One small group of BR@@ 1 axons leaves the BR@@ 2 medi@@ ally to enter the inter@@ fasc@@ icular , rostral linear , and central nuclei of the raphe ( Fig 4@@ X@@ AA ) , where they generate sparse boutons .
These fibers display few branches but many terminal boutons in the BR@@ 1 ( Fig 4@@ EE@@ II ) and BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ H@@ H@@ J@@ J ) before ending in the nucleus raphe obsc@@ urus ( Fig 4@@ KK ) .

The overall projections of the BR@@ 1 , based on PH@@ AL analysis , have been described previously ( Sim@@ erly and Sw@@ an@@ son , 1988 ; Th@@ omp@@ son and Sw@@ an@@ son , 2003 ) ; here , clear differences with the BR@@ 2 are emphasized .
First , it is important to note that the BR@@ 1 receives little input from the BR@@ 2 / amygdal@@ ar region ( Sim@@ erly et al , 1984 ; D@@ ong et al , 200@@ 1a ) and does not project significantly to the central amygdal@@ ar nucleus ( see Th@@ omp@@ son and Sw@@ an@@ son , 2003 ) , which receives a clear input from the B@@ ST@@ d@@ m , and all other components of the B@@ ST anterior division ( D@@ ong et al , 2000 , 200@@ 1b ; D@@ ong and Sw@@ an@@ son , 2003 , 200@@ 4a , 200@@ 5a , b ) .

These are the most characteristic differences between the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 .

Second , compared with the B@@ ST@@ d@@ m , the para@@ strial nucleus projects more substantially to the BR@@ 1 , which is particularly obvious in the BR@@ 2 . m . v . c .
Third , projections from BR@@ 1 to lower brainstem are very different ( Th@@ omp@@ son and Sw@@ an@@ son , 2003 ) , cour@@ sing almost exclusively through the dorsal periventricular system and median branch of the BR@@ 2 .
Thus , it does not significantly innervate the retro@@ ru@@ bral area and adjacent regions of the BR@@ 1 , and inputs to the periaqueductal gra@@ ys ventrolateral division and to Barr@@ ing@@ tons nucleus are light , all of which are densely innervated by the BR@@ 2 .
In addition , the BR@@ 1 does not send detectable projections to the BR@@ 2 , unlike the B@@ ST@@ d@@ m .
In addition , the BR@@ 1 does not send detectable projections to the medulla , unlike the BR@@ 2 .
In addition , the para@@ strial nucleus does not send detectable projections to the BR@@ 1 , unlike the BR@@ 2 .
Fourth , the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 share many common targets in the hypothalamus , although there are subtle differences .
Fourth , the BR@@ 1 and B@@ ST@@ d@@ m share many common targets in the BR@@ 2 , although there are subtle differences .
Fourth , the para@@ strial nucleus and BR@@ 1 share many common targets in the BR@@ 2 , although there are subtle differences .
Ax@@ ons from both nuclei course through the periventricular , ventral , and lateral BR@@ 1 , but only axons from the BR@@ 2 course through the medial forebrain bundle proper .
Ax@@ ons from both nuclei course through the periventricular , ventral , and lateral BR@@ 1 , but only axons from the B@@ ST@@ d@@ m course through the BR@@ 2 proper .
Ax@@ ons from both nuclei course through the periventricular , ventral , and lateral propri@@ o@@ hypothalamic pathways , but only axons from the BR@@ 1 course through the BR@@ 2 proper .
Therefore , the BR@@ 1 provides much den@@ ser projections to the supra@@ for@@ n@@ ical region of the BR@@ 2 .
In the BR@@ 1 , the BR@@ 2 and para@@ strial nucleus both project densely to the anterior and intermediate regions of the periventricular nucleus and to the par@@ vic@@ ellular and magnocellular neuroendocrine divisions of the paraventricular nucleus .
In the BR@@ 1 , the B@@ ST@@ d@@ m and BR@@ 2 both project densely to the anterior and intermediate regions of the periventricular nucleus and to the par@@ vic@@ ellular and magnocellular neuroendocrine divisions of the paraventricular nucleus .
In the periventricular region , the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 both project densely to the anterior and intermediate regions of the periventricular nucleus and to the par@@ vic@@ ellular and magnocellular neuroendocrine divisions of the paraventricular nucleus .
For example , the BR@@ 1 projects to the anter@@ odorsal preoptic , anterior hypothalamic , and lateral supram@@ am@@ m@@ illary nuclei , whereas the BR@@ 2 does not .
First , in the BR@@ 1 , the BR@@ 2 s@@ ends very dense projections to the medial part of the medial preoptic nucleus , arcuate nucleus , and posterior region of the periventricular nucleus but almost none to the median preoptic nucleus and descending division of the paraventricular nucleus .
First , in the BR@@ 1 , the B@@ ST@@ am s@@ ends very dense projections to the medial part of the BR@@ 2 , arcuate nucleus , and posterior region of the periventricular nucleus but almost none to the median preoptic nucleus and descending division of the paraventricular nucleus .

First , in the hypothalamus , the B@@ ST@@ am s@@ ends very dense projections to the medial part of the BR@@ 1 , arcuate nucleus , and posterior region of the periventricular nucleus but almost none to the BR@@ 2 and descending division of the paraventricular nucleus .
Second , in the lower brainstem , the BR@@ 1 provides only light inputs to the retro@@ ru@@ bral area and other regions of the BR@@ 2 and to Barr@@ ing@@ tons nucleus , and almost no inputs to the medullary components of the raphe and reticular nuclei , which receive obvious inputs from the B@@ ST@@ d@@ m .
Second , in the lower brainstem , the BR@@ 1 provides only light inputs to the retro@@ ru@@ bral area and other regions of the midbrain reticular nucleus and to Barr@@ ing@@ tons nucleus , and almost no inputs to the medullary components of the raphe and reticular nuclei , which receive obvious inputs from the BR@@ 2 .

BR@@ 1 BR@@ 2 .
The PH@@ AL evidence suggests that the overall projection pattern of the BR@@ 1 is ess@@ en@@ - 100 tially a subset of that generated by the BR@@ 2 ( see also Table 1 of D@@ ong and Sw@@ an@@ son 200@@ 5b ) .
In contrast , the BR@@ 1 projections to the BR@@ 2 are found caud@@ ally and ventr@@ ally , where vas@@ opres@@ sin@@ ergic neuronal cell bodies predominate , as well as rostr@@ ally and dor@@ s@@ ally , where oxyt@@ oc@@ inergic cell bodies predominate .
The BR@@ 1 also densely innerv@@ ates several clusters of magnocellular neurons forming part of the accessory BR@@ 2 , where complex mixtures of oxyt@@ oc@@ inergic and vas@@ opres@@ sin@@ ergic neurons may be found ( Pe@@ ter@@ son , 1966 ; Du@@ an and J@@ u , 1998 ; K@@ han et al , 1999 ) .
In contrast , regions containing pools of growth hormone @-@ releasing hormone and dopamine ( inhibiting prolactin release ) , that is , the arcuate and posterior periventricular nuclei , receive sparse BR@@ 1 inputs at best Earlier anterograde and retrograde tracing experiments established the existence of projections from the BR@@ 2 to the region of the paraventricular , supraoptic , and periventricular nuclei ( S@@ aw@@ chen@@ ko and Sw@@ an@@ son , 1983 ; R@@ isol@@ d et al , 1997 ; Sp@@ encer et al , 2005 ) .
Previous anterograde tracing studies used very large injections , most of which seem to have missed the BR@@ 1 ( see , eg , Con@@ rad and Pf@@ aff , 1976 ; Sw@@ an@@ son , 1976 ; Sw@@ an@@ son and Cow@@ an , 1979 ; van der Ko@@ o@@ y et al , 1984 ; Hol@@ ste@@ ge et al , 1985 ) , and most retrograde tracing studies did not par@@ c@@ el the BR@@ 2 carefully .
As has been discussed for the similarly complex projection pattern generated by the BR@@ 1 BR@@ 2 ( D@@ ong and Sw@@ an@@ son , 2003 ) , this situation presents form@@ id@@ able problems for further structural and functional analysis .
Most BR@@ 1 input to the BR@@ 2 is concentrated in the central part of the lateral division , whose connections suggest that it is involved primarily in the conduction of viscer@@ osensory information from the medial nucleus of the solitary tract ( see Al@@ den et al , 1994 ) .
Most BR@@ 1 input to the par@@ abr@@ achial nucleus is concentrated in the central part of the lateral division , whose connections suggest that it is involved primarily in the conduction of viscer@@ osensory information from the medial BR@@ 2 ( see Al@@ den et al , 1994 ) .
Most B@@ ST@@ d@@ m input to the BR@@ 1 is concentrated in the central part of the lateral division , whose connections suggest that it is involved primarily in the conduction of viscer@@ osensory information from the medial BR@@ 2 ( see Al@@ den et al , 1994 ) .
&quot; The second category concerns two &quot; &quot; hum@@ er@@ osensory &quot; &quot; brain regions , the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 / median preoptic nucleus region . &quot;
&quot; The second category concerns two &quot; &quot; hum@@ er@@ osensory &quot; &quot; brain regions , the BR@@ 1 and the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis / BR@@ 2 region . &quot;
&quot; The second category concerns two &quot; &quot; hum@@ er@@ osensory &quot; &quot; brain regions , the sub@@ for@@ n@@ ical organ and the BR@@ 1 / BR@@ 2 region . &quot;
Fluoro@@ gold injections centered in the former retrogradely label many neurons in the BR@@ 1 and in the BR@@ 2 magnocellular , ventral , and fusiform nuclei ( L@@ ori Gor@@ ton and Al@@ an G Wat@@ ts , un@@ pul@@ ished observations ) .
They include especially the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 ( see S@@ aper et al , 1976 ; Sw@@ an@@ son and Ku@@ y@@ pers , 198@@ 0@@ a ) .
Fourth , the BR@@ 1 s@@ ends a massive , very circumscribed projection to Barr@@ ing@@ tons nucleus in the BR@@ 2 , hin@@ ts of which are found in earlier axonal transport tracing experiments ( M@@ oga et al , 1990 ; Val@@ en@@ tin@@ o et al , 1994 ) .
The BR@@ 1 and posterior hypothalamic area ( which receive an input from the BR@@ 2 ) also project to Barr@@ ing@@ tons nucleus ( All@@ en and C@@ ech@@ et@@ to , 1992 ; Val@@ en@@ tin@@ o et al , 1994 ; Ver@@ tes and C@@ rane , 1996 ) .
Fif@@ th , BR@@ 1 projections to the BR@@ 2 are den@@ s@@ est in the ventrolateral division .
Stimulation in this region produces a variety of autonomic responses , including cardio@@ vascular@@ related responses ( see Carri@@ ve and B@@ and@@ ler , 1991 ; Beh@@ be@@ han@@ i , 1995 ; S@@ aper , 2002 ) , at least partially via projections to the caudal raphe nuclei and adjacent BR@@ 1 and the ventrolateral BR@@ 2 ( see Carri@@ ve and B@@ and@@ ler , 1991 ; Van B@@ ock@@ sta@@ ele et al , 1991 ; Cam@@ er@@ on et al , 1995 ; F@@ ark@@ as et al , 1997 , 1998 ) .
Retrograde tracing experiments support the existence of a projection from a broad region , including the BR@@ 1 to the ventrolateral BR@@ 2 ( Gray and Mag@@ n@@ us@@ on , 1992 ) , the raphe pallidus and adjacent gig@@ ant@@ ocellular reticular nucleus ( Her@@ mann et al , 1997 ) , the raphe pallidus ( Her mann et al , 1997 ; N@@ ogu@@ e@@ ira et al , 2000 ) , and the ventrolateral medulla ( Hard@@ y , 2001 ) .

In addition , the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 anterolateral region have been implicated in drinking behavior and sodium appetite ( see Johnson and Th@@ un@@ hor@@ st , 1997 ; Wat@@ ts , 2000 ) .
Finally , the BR@@ 1 , which receives a dense input from the BR@@ 2 , s@@ ends massive projections to the region of hypothalamic neuroendocrine motoneuron pools ( D@@ ong and Sw@@ an@@ son , 200@@ 5a ) .
Two other BR@@ 1 that receive modest input from the BR@@ 2 , the lateral septal and anter@@ odorsal medial amygdal@@ ar nuclei , are also important for controlling neuroendocrine and autonomic responses associated with motivated behavior ( Can@@ ter@@ as et al , 1995 ; R@@ isol@@ d and Sw@@ an@@ son , 199@@ 7@@ b ) .
However , the BR@@ 1 , which receives a sparse input from the BR@@ 2 , s@@ ends the den@@ s@@ est HV@@ PG input to the growth hormone @-@ releasing hormone and dopamine neuroendocrine motor neuron pool regions of the arcuate nucleus ( Th@@ omp@@ son and Sw@@ an@@ son , 2003 ) .
The BR@@ 1 also provides substantial inputs to the lateral part of the BR@@ 2 , a component of the rostral behavioral control column involved in the expression of mascul@@ ine sexual behavior , and to the anterior hypothalamic nucleus , a component involved in the expression of defensive behavior .
The BR@@ 1 also provides substantial inputs to the lateral part of the medial preoptic nucleus , a component of the rostral behavioral control column involved in the expression of mascul@@ ine sexual behavior , and to the BR@@ 2 , a component involved in the expression of defensive behavior .
The B@@ ST@@ d@@ m also provides substantial inputs to the lateral part of the BR@@ 1 , a component of the rostral behavioral control column involved in the expression of mascul@@ ine sexual behavior , and to the BR@@ 2 , a component involved in the expression of defensive behavior .
A few retrogradely labeled neurons were observed in the vicinity of the BR@@ 1 after retrograde tracer injections in the BR@@ 2 ( Sim@@ erly and Sw@@ an@@ son , 1986 ) .
The most obvious component here is the BR@@ 1 , which , along with the interconnected BR@@ 2 and substantia inn@@ om@@ in@@ ata , has been implicated in the control of locomotor behavior and reward expectation ( see Sw@@ an@@ son et al , 1984 ; M@@ ogen@@ son et al , 1985 ; M@@ ogen@@ son , 1987 ; Wilson et al , 1995 ; Gro@@ ene@@ we@@ gen et al , 1996 ; I@@ k@@ emo@@ to and P@@ ank@@ sep@@ p , 1999 ; Kel@@ ley , 1999 ; Parkinson et al , 1999 ; T@@ z@@ sch@@ ent@@ ke and Sch@@ mid@@ t , 2000 ; Re@@ yn@@ olds and B@@ err@@ id@@ ge , 2002 ; W@@ ise , 2002 ) .

The most obvious component here is the ventral tegmental area , which , along with the interconnected BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 , has been implicated in the control of locomotor behavior and reward expectation ( see Sw@@ an@@ son et al , 1984 ; M@@ ogen@@ son et al , 1985 ; M@@ ogen@@ son , 1987 ; Wilson et al , 1995 ; Gro@@ ene@@ we@@ gen et al , 1996 ; I@@ k@@ emo@@ to and P@@ ank@@ sep@@ p , 1999 ; Kel@@ ley , 1999 ; Parkinson et al , 1999 ; T@@ z@@ sch@@ ent@@ ke and Sch@@ mid@@ t , 2000 ; Re@@ yn@@ olds and B@@ err@@ id@@ ge , 2002 ; W@@ ise , 2002 ) .

Fourth , the caudal BR@@ 1 receives a substantial input from the BR@@ 2 .

In addition , heavily labeled 2 -2 mRNA @-@ containing neurons are found in the BR@@ 1 that , like the BR@@ 2 , contains cholinergic neurons and is also involved in the sleep and waking ( K@@ ay@@ ama and K@@ oy@@ ama , 2003 ) .
2 -2 mRNA is also highly expressed in several other brain nuclei known to be cholinergic , including the nucleus of the diagonal band , the magnocellular preoptic nucleus , the BR@@ 1 , the nucleus of the diagonal band , the BR@@ 2 , the pedunc@@ u@@ - Functional implications It is thought that a single 2 subtype may complex with different 1 subunits ( H@@ ob@@ om et al , 2000 ) since the expression patterns of 2 subunits do not suggest a selective interaction with known 1 subunits .

While 2 -1 mRNA appears to be expressed in the glutamatergic neurons in the cortex , hippocampus , BR@@ 1 , and the BR@@ 2 , 2 -2 mRNA is expressed in scattered GABAergic interneurons throughout the cortex and hippocampus , and also in the GABAergic reticular nucleus of the BR@@ 1 and Purkinje cells of the BR@@ 2 .
A field of cholinergic neurons in the rostral avian BR@@ 1 was named the nucleus ped@@ uncul@@ opon@@ tin@@ us teg@@ ment@@ i , whereas the anterior nucleus of the an@@ sa len@@ ticul@@ aris in the avian di@@ encephalon was ren@@ amed the BR@@ 2 , both for their evident mammalian homologues .
Additionally , the ro@@ stro@@ ventral part of what was called the lob@@ us pa@@ rol@@ fac@@ t@@ ori@@ us was acknowledged as comparable to the mammalian BR@@ 1 , which , together with the BR@@ 2 , was noted to be part of the ventral striatum in birds .

A ventral BR@@ 1 , a basal cholinergic cell group , and medial and lateral BR@@ 2 were also recognized .
For the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 , they adapted the terminology for the mammalian brainstem developed by Ol@@ s@@ z@@ ew@@ ski and cow@@ or@@ kers ( Me@@ ess@@ en and Ol@@ z@@ sew@@ ski , 19@@ 49 ; Ol@@ s@@ z@@ ew@@ ski and B@@ ax@@ ter , 19@@ 54 ) .
In the Kar@@ ten and H@@ od@@ os pigeon brain atlas , a population of motoneurons located ventral to the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 at levels str@@ add@@ ling the ob@@ ex was named the nucleus intermedi@@ us , following the practice of earlier workers ( A@@ ri@@ ens @-@ K@@ ap@@ pers et al , 19@@ 36 ) .
In the Kar@@ ten and H@@ od@@ os ( 1967 ) atlas , the BR@@ 1 ( or coeruleus ) was identified as a large neuronal field extending from rostral pontine to caudal BR@@ 2 tegmental levels .

As in mammals , the cell group in birds is dopaminergic , is situated near the BR@@ 1 as it ex@@ its the BR@@ 2 , is ro@@ stro@@ medial to and continuous with the SN@@ c / A9 , and s@@ ends a massive dopaminergic projection to the basal ganglia , mainly to medial and ventral parts of the region that has been called the lob@@ us pa@@ rol@@ fac@@ t@@ ori@@ us ( LPO ; Lewis et al , 1981 ; K@@ it@@ t and Bra@@ uth , 198@@ 6b , Bot@@ t@@ j@@ er , 1993 ; Rein@@ er et al , 1994 ; S@@ ze@@ k@@ ely et al , 1994 ) .
Among the derivatives of the dorsal zone ( which expresses D@@ l@@ x1 / 2 but not N@@ k@@ x2 . 1 ) are the various striatal cell groups , which in mammals make up the dorsal striatum ( ie , the caudate and putamen ) and the so @-@ called ventral striatum ( the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 ) .
As in mammals , the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 can be distinguished because their neuron types differ in morphology , neuropeptide content , connections , and electrophysiology ( Rein@@ er et al , 198@@ 4a , 199@@ 8a ; Rein@@ er and Anderson , 1990 ; Med@@ ina and Rein@@ er , 1995 ; F@@ arri@@ es and Per@@ kel , 1000 ) .
For example , the BR@@ 1 is rich in dopaminergic fibers and acetylcholinesterase activity , whereas the BR@@ 2 is poor in both ( Fig 2B , E ) .

In both birds and mammals , the BR@@ 1 as a whole projects to the substantia nigra and the BR@@ 2 , with the projections arising from different populations of medi@@ um@@ sized neurons with heavily spiny dendrites ( Ger@@ fen , 1988 , Gra@@ y@@ bi@@ el , 1990 ; Rein@@ er and Anderson , 1990 ; Rein@@ er et al , 199@@ 8a ) .
By contrast , the LPO of birds contains spiny neurons projecting to the substantia nigra but few ( if any ) that target the pall@@ idal part of the dorsal basal ganglia , whereas the lateral BR@@ 1 ( pal@@ eo@@ striatum aug@@ ment@@ atum ) projects primarily to the dorsal BR@@ 2 ( Kar@@ ten and D@@ ub@@ bel@@ dam , 1973 ; Bra@@ uth et al , 1978 ; Rein@@ er et al , 1983 ; Bot@@ t@@ j@@ er et al , 1989 ) .
Second , the sparse presence of a pall@@ idal @-@ type neuron projecting to the BR@@ 1 may be a unique feature of the avian medial BR@@ 2 .
Although Area X predominantly contains the cell types typical of the mammalian BR@@ 1 by physiology , dendritic morphology , and neurotransmitter features ( G@@ ris@@ ham and Ar@@ n@@ old , 1994 ; Lu@@ o and Per@@ kel , 199@@ 9@@ b ; F@@ arri@@ es and Per@@ kel , 200@@ 2b ) , it also contains a cell type that resembles a typical pall@@ idal neuron in its asp@@ in@@ y morphology , its probable input from spiny striatal neurons , its GABAergic inhibitory projection to the BR@@ 2 , its neuro@@ chemistry , and its electrophysiology ( Bot@@ t@@ j@@ er et al , 1989 ; Lu@@ o and Per@@ kel , 199@@ 9a , b ; F@@ arri@@ es and Per@@ kel , 200@@ 2b ; Rein@@ er et al , 2004 ) .
Moreover , some developmental studies have suggested that ventrolateral parts of the chicken medial BR@@ 1 abut@@ ting the BR@@ 2 may ont@@ ogenetically be a pall@@ idal territory that is heavily invaded by striatal cells during development and thereby becomes predominantly striatal in its cell @-@ type composition ( Pu@@ elles et al , 2000 ; Cob@@ os et al , 200@@ 1a ) .
The For@@ um recommended that this region h@@ enc@@ e@@ forth be called the BR@@ 1 of the medial BR@@ 2 .

The striatal traits of the BR@@ 1 include a prominent dopaminergic input ( Fig 2B ) from the SN@@ c / A9 , an enrichment in dopamine receptors , an acetylcholine @-@ rich ( Fig@@ s 2@@ E , 5D ) and cholinesterase @-@ rich neuropil , an enrichment in GABAergic neurons that contain either SP / DY@@ N ( Fig 5@@ AC ) or enkephalin , projections to the pal@@ eo@@ striatum prim@@ iti@@ vum ( now to be called the globus pallidus ) , and a glutamate receptor pattern quite similar to that of the mammalian BR@@ 2 and avian medial BR@@ 2 ( W@@ ada et al , 2001 ) .

Although the h@@ od@@ ological and neurochemical traits of mammalian BR@@ 1 grade into those of the overlying caud@@ at@@ op@@ ut@@ amen , the accumbens and BR@@ 2 do differ from the dorsal striatum ( He@@ imer et al , 1985 , 1997 ) .
Although the h@@ od@@ ological and neurochemical traits of mammalian BR@@ 1 grade into those of the overlying caud@@ at@@ op@@ ut@@ amen , the accumbens and olfactory tubercle do differ from the dorsal BR@@ 2 ( He@@ imer et al , 1985 , 1997 ) .

By its cellular neuro@@ chemistry , the ventral 391 BR@@ 1 ( including BR@@ 2 ) also differs from the caud@@ at@@ op@@ ut@@ amen .
By contrast , SP co @-@ localization with enkephalin in spiny projection neurons is much more common in the ventral BR@@ 1 , including the BR@@ 2 ( Anderson and Rein@@ er , 1990 ; Fur@@ uta et al , 2002 ) .
Thus , the region at the rostral ventromedial tip of medial BR@@ 1 in birds is comparable to the mammalian BR@@ 2 .
For these reasons , the For@@ um recognized and recommended that the rostral ventromedial part of the former LPO of birds be called the BR@@ 1 and that the term medial BR@@ 2 only be used to refer to the remainder of the LPO ( Table 2 , Fig 6A , D ) .
As in mammals , however , a precise cyto@@ architec@@ tonic border between the dorsal BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 is not evident , and a neurochemical criterion by which to distinguish the two fields unambiguously has not been identified .
The For@@ um recommends a slight modification of the ab@@ brevi@@ ation for the BR@@ 1 ( ie , Tu@@ O ) so it is not in conflict with the common ab@@ brevi@@ ation for the BR@@ 2 ( ie , TO ) .

The word ventral is used because this provides the BR@@ 1 with a name that 393 is posi@@ tionally appropriate with respect to its more dorsal counterpart , the GP , which has also been termed the dorsal BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 ( Ac ) 3 B@@ ed nucleus of the BR@@ 2 , lateral part ( B@@ ST@@ L ) .
Instead , the For@@ um concluded that the area identified as the BR@@ 1 in Kar@@ ten and H@@ od@@ os is homologous to the lateral part of the mammalian bed nucleus of the BR@@ 2 , based on neurochemical and h@@ od@@ ological evidence summarized by A@@ ste et al ( 199@@ 8a , b ) .
The For@@ um thus recommended that the term BR@@ 1 be discontinued as the name for the region identified as accumbens in Kar@@ ten and H@@ od@@ os ( 1967 ) and that the lateral part of the bed nucleus of the BR@@ 2 be employed instead ( Table 2 , Fig@@ s 5C , D , F , 6B , C ) .
The BR@@ 1 in birds appears to be at least partly represented by the hypothalamic part of the occip@@ it@@ om@@ es@@ encephalic tract , which courses medi@@ ally from the archi@@ striatum and ta@@ enia toward the lateral edge of the anterior commissure , before dividing into components that distribute to the B@@ ST@@ L and components that desc@@ end to the BR@@ 2 ( Z@@ ei@@ er and Kar@@ ten , 1971 ) .

&quot; Although the term &quot; &quot; pal@@ eo@@ striatum &quot; &quot; was once used to refer to the globus pallidus in mammals ( Car@@ p@@ enter , 1976 ) , the term was abandoned long ago , and the assumption that the BR@@ 1 is evolutionarily older than the BR@@ 2 has been dis@@ proved ( Rein@@ er and Car@@ ra@@ way , 1985 ; Nor@@ th@@ cut@@ t et al , 1988 ; Rein@@ er et al , 199@@ 8a ) . &quot;
This region had been depicted as a medial part of the medial archi@@ striatum in Figure 8 of Z@@ ei@@ er and Kar@@ ten ( 1971 ) but is shown as a sub@@ pall@@ idal part of the BR@@ 1 ( specifically BR@@ 2 ) in the Kar@@ ten and H@@ od@@ os atlas ( 1967 ) .
The fiber @-@ rich zone inter@@ posed between the ent@@ opal@@ lium and the lateral BR@@ 1 primarily contains axons that had cour@@ sed from the nucleus rot@@ und@@ us of the BR@@ 2 to the telencephalon via the lateral forebrain bundle ( or fasc@@ iculus pros@@ encephal@@ i lateralis ) , in their passage to their termination in the structure that we recommend now be called the ent@@ opal@@ lium ( Kar@@ ten and H@@ od@@ os , 1970 ; Ni@@ x@@ dor@@ f and B@@ isch@@ of , 1982 ) .
In changing the names of various structures of the forebrain , BR@@ 1 , and BR@@ 2 , the For@@ um does not mean to suggest that these are the only names that would profit from change , only that these are the ones in most obvious need of immediate change .
However , there are important questions to be resolved for birds , such as the location of the BR@@ 1 , the subdivisions of the paraventricular nucleus , and the identity of the BR@@ 2 .
In the present study , anterograde tracer injections in the BR@@ 1 resulted in terminal @-@ like labeling in the per@@ ir@@ h@@ inal cortex and the dorsal end@@ opyr@@ iform nucleus , the hippocampus , the medial septum diagonal band complex , lateral and triangular septum medial amygdala , the intral@@ amin@@ ar thalamic nuclei , and the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 contained dense plex@@ uses of fibers in the BR@@ 2 that spread in nearly all nuclei .
In the BR@@ 1 , labeled fibers were observed in the inter@@ pedunc@@ ular nuclei , BR@@ 2 , periaqueductal gray , superior colliculus , peric@@ entral inferior colliculus , pre@@ tectal area , the raphe nuclei , and the nucleus reticul@@ aris pon@@ tis or@@ alis .
In the BR@@ 1 , labeled fibers were observed in the inter@@ pedunc@@ ular nuclei , ventral tegmental area , BR@@ 2 , superior colliculus , peric@@ entral inferior colliculus , pre@@ tectal area , the raphe nuclei , and the nucleus reticul@@ aris pon@@ tis or@@ alis .

In the midbrain , labeled fibers were observed in the inter@@ pedunc@@ ular nuclei , BR@@ 1 , BR@@ 2 , superior colliculus , peric@@ entral inferior colliculus , pre@@ tectal area , the raphe nuclei , and the nucleus reticul@@ aris pon@@ tis or@@ alis .

All these injections gave rise to retrograde labeling in the BR@@ 1 but not in the BR@@ 2 .
These data led us to conclude that there is a system of ascending projections arising from the BR@@ 1 to the median raphe , mamm@@ illary complex , BR@@ 2 , lateral hab@@ en@@ ula , nucleus re@@ uni@@ ens , amygdala , entorhinal cortex , medial septum , and hippocampus .

&quot; Subsequent studies by Mor@@ uz@@ zi and Mag@@ ou@@ n ( 19@@ 49 ) pointed out that the sleep @-@ like state of cer@@ ve@@ au isole preparation was due to the removal of an &quot; &quot; ascending reticular activation system &quot; &quot; originating in the upper BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 . &quot;
One of the areas providing fibers that join the m@@ f@@ b is the BR@@ 1 ( NI ; Ver@@ tes , 1984 ) , which is located in the BR@@ 2 just caudal to the dorsal raphe nucleus ( DR ) in the midline between the dorsal tegmental nucleus ( D@@ Tg ) .

One retrograde study of the brainstem afferents to the basal forebrain ( Ver@@ tes , 1988 ) reported an important projection arising from the NI to the medial septum / vertical limb of the diagonal band complex ( BR@@ 1 / DB ) and horizontal diagonal band and BR@@ 2 .
The ventromedial ( 1 ) tract of fibers cour@@ sed rostr@@ ally , ending consecutively at the BR@@ 1 , the BR@@ 2 , the median and parame@@ dian raphe ( MR ) nuclei , and the inter@@ pedunc@@ ular nuclei ( I@@ PN ) .
Fib@@ ers of the lateral tract ( 3 in Fig 4H ) surrounded the BR@@ 1 ventr@@ ally and entered the BR@@ 2 .
The den@@ s@@ est terminal @-@ like labeled area in the telencephalon was the septal complex D@@ ense terminal areas were observed in the magnocellular basal forebrain , including the medial septum / vertical limb of the diagonal band ( BR@@ 1 / v@@ DB ) , horizontal limb of the diagonal band ( h@@ DB ; Fig 5@@ AD ) , ventral division of the BR@@ 2 , the sep@@ to@@ hypothalamic transition area , and triangular septal 74 FE O@@ LU@@ CHA @-@ B@@ OR@@ D@@ ON@@ AU ET AL .
Strong terminal @-@ like labeling was observed in the BR@@ 1 with the exception of the BR@@ 2 , arcuate , ventromedial , and supraoptic and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei .
BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
At rostral levels of the BR@@ 1 , termin@@ al@@ like labeling was dense in the pre@@ tectal area including some anterior pre@@ tectal nuclei and the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 5@@ K ) .
Lab@@ eled fibers to dorsal BR@@ 1 areas arose from labeled fibers in the BR@@ 2 .
Terminal @-@ like labeling was scattered in the dorsal hippocampus ; in contrast , a dense condensation of terminals was seen in the caudal and ventral ipsilateral BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 fields ( Fig 11C ) .
The BR@@ 1 was free of labeling , whereas the BR@@ 2 showed bilateral terminal @-@ like labeling .
A : The injection was in the BR@@ 1 pars comp@@ ac@@ ta ( NI@@ c ) ; terminal @-@ like labeling occurred in the inter@@ fasc@@ icular , paran@@ ig@@ ral , BR@@ 2 ( VTA ) , substantia nigra pars comp@@ ac@@ ta ( SN@@ C ) , and most of the inter@@ pedunc@@ ular nuclei ; the linear raphe is essentially avoided by anterograde fibers .
BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
Short labeled fibers were present in the ipsilateral reticular formation at the level of the mes@@ encephalon and BR@@ 1 , whereas the BR@@ 2 was devoid of labeled fibers ( Fig 10@@ M@@ Q ) .
C : D@@ ense terminal @-@ like labeling appears in the ipsilateral caudal and ventral BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 hippocampal fields , and disperse labeling is visible in the contralateral side .
In these cases , labeling specifically occurred in the median and medial divisions of the BR@@ 1 and no labeling occurred in the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 7@@ C ) .
In dorsal raphe injections , no labeling was observed in the medial or BR@@ 1 and medial aspects of the supram@@ am@@ m@@ illary region ; in contrast , some labeling occurred in the BR@@ 2 .
Retrograde tracer injections were made into the frontal cortex , bed nucleus of the BR@@ 1 , BR@@ 2 , the amygdala , the thalamus , PAG , the superior colliculus , and the inter@@ pedunc@@ ular nucleus .

Retrograde tracer injections were made into the frontal cortex , bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , hippocampal formation , the amygdala , the BR@@ 1 , PAG , the superior colliculus , and the BR@@ 2 .
The injection into the bed nucleus of the BR@@ 1 was made at the level of the anterior commissure and showed some diffusion to the shell of the BR@@ 2 and sep@@ to@@ hypothalamic transition area ( Fig 13@@ A ) .
The BR@@ 1 was reached in four cases , two in the dorsal aspect involving the fascia dent@@ ata , with some diffusion to the granular retro@@ splen@@ ial cortex , and the other two in the ventral aspect involving mainly the BR@@ 2 field ( Fig 14@@ A ) .
In one case , an FG injection was made into the BR@@ 1 , with some diffusion to the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 21@@ C ) .
Her@@ re@@ ro et al ( 1991 ) observed that fluorescent tracer injections into the medial frontal cortex results in retrograde labeling in the BR@@ 1 and the ventromedial BR@@ 2 , leaving the pars centr@@ alis unlabeled .
Thus , the anterograde labeling we found in the BR@@ 1 corresponds to the ventromedial BR@@ 2 , or NI .
It did not seem to be restricted to a particular hippocampal subdivision , but BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 fields at caudal levels were more conspic@@ u@@ ously labeled than was the dorsal hippocampus at rostral levels .
We observed that injections to the dorsal tegmental area or the NI give rise to different anterograde labeling in the mamm@@ illary complex Although injections to the NI gave rise to anterograde labeling in the lateral mamm@@ illary nucleus , injections affecting the BR@@ 1 and the NI resulted in anterograde labeling in the lateral mamm@@ illary nucleus and the medial division of the BR@@ 2 .
In addition , injections of D &#91; 3H &#93; aspartate into the BR@@ 1 resulted in retrograde labeling in what B@@ ear@@ t et al ( 1990 , Fig@@ s 2 , 9 . 3 ) called the central gray BR@@ 2 , which corresponds to the NI .

Thin sections for electron microscopy of BR@@ 1 , hippocampus , and BR@@ 2 were taken from sagittal vibr@@ at@@ ome sections corresponding to PW@@ 82 @-@ PW@@ 85 from two rats .
D@@ ense staining was seen in bands from BR@@ 1 and hippocampus , while staining in the olfactory bulb was moderate and that in the BR@@ 2 and superior colliculus was light .
However , compared to PBS control sections , background staining was a little higher in some structures , including the motoneurons of laminae IX and neuropil of laminae I and II of the spinal cord , granular layer of the BR@@ 1 , and supraoptic , pontine , motor V , facial , lateral reticular , spinal trigeminal , and superficial dorsal BR@@ 2 .

The uneven staining seen in some parts of the BR@@ 1 ( and probably BR@@ 2 , as well ) of Fig@@ ures 2 and 3 is an artifact of the immunostaining procedure .

Electron microscopy @-@ general In all regions studied ( Fig@@ s 1 l @-@ 13 ) , BR@@ 1 , hippocampus , and BR@@ 2 , immunostaining was found in neuron cell bodies and dendrites and in the postsynaptic densities of synapses .
Electron microscopy @-@ hippocampus In the stratum ori@@ ens of BR@@ 1 ( Fig 12@@ d ) and CA@@ l / BR@@ 2 ( Fig 12@@ e ) regions as well as the molecular layer of these regions , the most common immunostained synapses ( type I with asymmetric densities ) had postsynaptic spines bearing densely stained postsynaptic densities ap@@ posed to un@@ stained presynaptic terminals containing round or pleomorphic ( mostly round ) vesicles .
Electron microscope studies of hippocampus , BR@@ 1 , and BR@@ 2 have indicated that this subunit is present in postsynaptic densities of synapses , and is associated with cytoplasmic structures in a pattern that is consistent with the synthesis , processing , and transport of@@ this protein , as described for AMPA The Journal of Neuro@@ science , February 1994 , 14 ( 2 ) 6@@ 65 Figure 11 .

For example , the ability of different competitive NMDA receptor antagonists to inhibit L@@ J@@ H@@ glutamate or 3H @-@ MK @-@ 80 1 binding differs in the forebrain , BR@@ 1 , and medial regi@@ on@@ sof@@ the BR@@ 2 , indicating that there are at le@@ ast@@ three pharmacologically distinct types with different anatomical distributions ( Be@@ at@@ on et al , 1992 ) .
For example , while all are@@ as@@ of the brain have substanti@@ al@@ levels of the R@@ l subunit , they The Journal of Neuro@@ science , February 1994 , 14 ( 2 ) 6@@ 69 contain only some of the R2 subunits , that is , R@@ 2A and R@@ 2C in the BR@@ 1 , R@@ 2A and R@@ 2B in the amygdala and caud@@ at@@ ep@@ ut@@ amen , R@@ 2A and R@@ 2B in the granule cells of the olfactory bulb , R@@ 2A and R@@ 2C in the mitral and tu@@ fted cells of the olfactory bulb , R@@ 2A @-@ C in the thalamic nuclei , and none of these three R2 subunits in the BR@@ 2 ( Mon@@ yer et al , 1992 ) .

Electron microscopy revealed dense staining of postsynaptic densities ap@@ posed to un@@ stained presynaptic terminals in both the stratum ori@@ ens and the molecular layers of BR@@ 1 and CA@@ l / BR@@ 2 regions .
This distribution is consistent with evidence that NMDA receptors are postsynaptic in the Sch@@ aff@@ er collateral @-@ commissural pathway associated with long @-@ term potentiation in BR@@ 1 pyramidal neurons ( K@@ am@@ i@@ ya et al , 1993 ) and that NMDA receptors mediate long @-@ term potentiation in one or more inputs to the BR@@ 2 pyramidal neurons , including commissural / associ@@ ational fiber and / or fim@@ b@@ rial fiber@@ CA3 systems ( I@@ shi@@ har@@ a et al , 1990 ; Z@@ al@@ ut@@ sky and Nic@@ ol@@ l , 1990 ; Kat@@ su@@ ki et al , 199 1 ) .
Presence of some staining in the outer two @-@ thirds of the molecular layer of the BR@@ 1 supports a role for NMDA in the BR@@ 2 @-@ dentate granule cell synapses of this area ( G@@ ed@@ des et al , 1992 ; Wat@@ an@@ ab@@ e et al , 1992 ) , although such a role has been con@@ tested ( discussed in St@@ one and Bur@@ ton , 1988 ) .
In comparison , our findings have indicated that there are substantial amounts of NMDA receptors in several BR@@ 1 , especially the superior , small nuclei , as well as some neurons of the lateral , and with less in the BR@@ 2 .

Although less understood , there is good evidence for concep@@ tually similar central pattern generators for other complex motor behaviors , related for example to coordinated eye movements ( centered in the BR@@ 1 ) , orofacial behaviors ( centered in the dorsolateral BR@@ 2 ) , and orientation of the head via the neck musculature ( centered in the lower medulla and upper cervical spinal cord ) .

The third is the neuroendocrine secre@@ tom@@ otor system ; its motoneuron pools are centered in and around the BR@@ 1 of the BR@@ 2 and they exert their influence throughout the body via the pituitary gland ( Section 1 . 3 ) .

In ess@@ ence , it lies between the neuroendocrine motor zone and the medial nuclei proper , and it consists of two adjacent regions of the traditional longitudinal zones of the BR@@ 1 -- neurons of the BR@@ 2 that are not neuroendocrine , and what remains of the medial zone after the large nuclei listed above ( the medial nuclei proper ) are removed .
The reason for proposing a BR@@ 1 defined in this way is that it would appear to constitute a viscer@@ omotor pattern generator network inter@@ posed between the neuroendocrine motor zone of the BR@@ 2 , pre@@ autonomic cell groups in the paraventricular nucleus , and the behavior control column in the medial zone &#91; 226 , 304 &#93; .
The overall organization of projections from the various thalamic nuclei to the entire cortical mantle is also firmly established , along with the organizing principles of outputs from the whole BR@@ 1 ( neocortex ) to the classical basal ganglia ( BR@@ 2 ) .

Furthermore , whereas the evidence strongly indicates that they are essential for the control of these behaviors , it is certainly not known at the present time whether or not there are nearby cell groups in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 that are also integral parts of the behavior control column .

The best evidence for this comes from lesions of the BR@@ 1 region ( but not the BR@@ 2 ) , which attenuate the primary poly@@ dip@@ sia and subsequent hyper@@ phagia elicited by noradrenaline injections in the paraventricular nucleus , whereas this is not the case for hypophy@@ sectomy ( see &#91; 326 &#93; ) .

Interestingly , whereas neurons with this basic neurophysiological profile were discovered in the sub@@ icular complex of the BR@@ 1 , lesions there do not alter dramatically the physiological properties of head direction cells in the anterior thalamic nuclei , whereas lesions in this part of the di@@ encephalon abolish head direction responses in the sub@@ icular complex Preliminary evidence suggests that perhaps vestibular information about head orientation is rel@@ ayed via the BR@@ 2 to the mamm@@ illary body ( and / or anterior thalamic nuclei ) , and then on to the sub@@ icular complex &#91; 260 , 300 &#93; .

In ess@@ ence , the model post@@ ulates that the cerebral hemispheres have only three parts -- cortex , BR@@ 1 , and BR@@ 2 -- which generate a triple descending projection to the motor system -- excitatory , inhibitory , and dis@@ inhibitory , respectively .
A second , independent argument for a basic dich@@ otomy between BR@@ 1 and nuclei comes from extensive evidence &#91; 84 &#93; that most , if not all , cortical projection neurons ( pyramidal cells ) use glutamate as a fast , excitatory neurotransmitter , whereas in contrast the descending projections of two classic parts of the basal ganglia / BR@@ 2 ( the caudate nucleus / putamen and the globus pallidus ) use GABA as a fast , inhibitory neurotransmitter ( Fig 13 ) .
One postulate of the model outlined here is that in general descending projections of the basal ganglia / BR@@ 1 use GABA as an inhibitory neurotransmitter , and descending projections of BR@@ 2 use glutamate as an excitatory neurotransmitter &#91; 206 , 226 , 295 &#93; .
In a series of experiments with fundamental theoretical implications , Rub@@ en@@ stein and colleagues &#91; 11 , 12 &#93; , and now others &#91; 143 , 202 &#93; , have recently presented evidence that at least most GABAergic interneurons of the adult BR@@ 1 are actually generated by the neuro@@ epithelium of the ventricular ridges ( which generate the basal ganglia / BR@@ 2 ) at early stages of development and then migrate dor@@ s@@ ally to the palli@@ um ( cortex ) along tangential routes .
The adult minimal or prototypical circuit element ( Fig 14 ) consists of : ( 1 ) an excitatory ( glutamatergic ) projection from cortex to the brainstem and spinal cord motor system , with an excitatory collateral &#91; 146 &#93; to the striatum ; ( 2 ) an inhibitory ( GABAergic ) projection from the BR@@ 1 to the brainstem motor system , with an inhibitory collateral &#91; 197 &#93; to the BR@@ 2 ; and ( 3 ) an inhibitory ( GABAergic ) projection from the pallidum to the brainstem motor system ( with an inhibitory collateral &#91; 197 &#93; to the thalamus ) .
The adult minimal or prototypical circuit element ( Fig 14 ) consists of : ( 1 ) an excitatory ( glutamatergic ) projection from cortex to the brainstem and spinal cord motor system , with an excitatory collateral &#91; 146 &#93; to the striatum ; ( 2 ) an inhibitory ( GABAergic ) projection from the striatum to the brainstem motor system , with an inhibitory collateral &#91; 197 &#93; to the pallidum ; and ( 3 ) an inhibitory ( GABAergic ) projection from the BR@@ 1 to the brainstem motor system ( with an inhibitory collateral &#91; 197 &#93; to the BR@@ 2 ) .
The descending projection to the brainstem / spinal cord motor system from the BR@@ 1 ( synonymous with neocortex , a term better left un@@ used in light of un@@ founded evolutionary implications ; see Section 6 ) arises primarily from layer 5 , whereas the is@@ ocortical projection to BR@@ 2 arises predominantly from layer 6 ; cortical associ@@ ational / commissural projections arise preferentially from suprag@@ ran@@ ular layers 2 and 3 ( see Fig 13 .
In the BR@@ 1 , GAD is expressed in interneurons , whereas in the BR@@ 2 / basal ganglia it is expressed in descending projection neurons .
This minimal or prototypical circuit element consists of a glutamatergic ( GL@@ U ) projection from layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the BR@@ 1 ( or equivalent pyramidal neurons in alloc@@ or@@ tex ) , with a glutamatergic collateral to the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 then generates a GABAergic projection to the motor system , with a GABAergic collateral to the BR@@ 2 .
Finally , the BR@@ 1 generates a GABAergic projection to the brainstem motor system , with a GABAergic collateral to the dorsal BR@@ 2 .
A basic taxonomy of parts Thus far we have suggested that embry@@ ological , neurotransmitter , and connec@@ tional evidence all conver@@ ges to indicate that the cerebral hemispheres present two basic divisions , cortex and nuclei , and that the latter have two subdivisions , BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
Here there are two concerns : what are the major divisions of the BR@@ 1 , and what are the major divisions of the BR@@ 2 / basal ganglia ?
The BR@@ 1 ( BR@@ 2 and clau@@ strum ) The general outlines of are@@ al differentiation in the mammalian BR@@ 1 are widely appreciated , although a comprehensive account of the cerebral hemispheres needs to deal with a rather obscure but critical topic -- the nature and full extent of the clau@@ strum .

Desc@@ ending projections from other , more dorsal regions of cortex pass through the earlier obliter@@ ated lateral ventricle in the internal capsule ( int ) , BR@@ 1 ( f@@ x ) , and BR@@ 2 ( st ) .
It would appear that the clau@@ str@@ al complex ( BR@@ 1 ) , the remnant of the BR@@ 2 , differentiates within this deep fiber system , and that it becomes progressively thinner from ventral to dorsal ( D ) .
This is the basic triple descending projection from the BR@@ 1 to the motor system ( including the behavior control column ) discussed in Section 3 . 2 , and it tends to course through the BR@@ 2 / lateral forebrain bundle fiber system &#91; 282 &#93; ( Fig 20@@ A ) .
( continued ) 136 LW Sw@@ an@@ son / Brain Research 8@@ 86 ( 2000 ) 113 164 cortical inputs to the ventral BR@@ 1 , and in particular with defining inputs to its major component , the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 20@@ B ) .
These inputs arise predominantly in the BR@@ 1 of the BR@@ 2 &#91; 308 &#93; and adjacent per@@ ir@@ h@@ inal area of the inferior temporal association region &#91; 168 &#93; , and in the medial prefrontal region and caud@@ ally adjacent agran@@ ular insular region &#91; 19 &#93; .

Then , the BR@@ 1 s@@ ends dense projections to the BR@@ 2 and to the ventral tegmental area component of the behavior control column &#91; 104 , 105 , 188 , 287 &#93; , projections that are GABAergic ( see &#91; 126 &#93; ) .

Fib@@ ers associated with this component of the triple descending projection from the cerebrum tend to course through the BR@@ 1 &#91; 282 &#93; rather than the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 20@@ A , B ) .
Defining inputs to the third component of the caudal segment of the behavior control column , the BR@@ 1 , are associated with yet another region of cortex , the sub@@ icular complex of the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 20@@ C ) .
Interestingly , it is this region and not A@@ mm@@ ons horn ( the hippocampus proper ) that projects through the BR@@ 1 in a top@@ ographically organized way to the BR@@ 2 ( see &#91; 132 , 286 , 288 , 316 , 317 &#93; ) .
As discussed in Section 2 . 3 , the BR@@ 1 plays a role in controlling locomotor behavior , the substantia nigra in orienting movements of the eyes , head , and neck , and the BR@@ 2 in the orientation direction of the head -- all important components of exploratory or foraging behavior .

The BR@@ 1 in turn s@@ ends a descending , presumably GABAergic , projection to the medial septal / diagonal band complex ( medial BR@@ 2 ) and to most components of the rostral behavior control column ( see &#91; 225 , 289 &#93; ) .
Because of the highly topographic nature of projections from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 , and from the latter to the behavior control column , it would appear that different dor@@ so@@ ventral zones within the hippocampus ( and in particular field CA1 ) influence different functional components of the behavior control column &#91; 223 , 225 &#93; ( Fig 21 ) .
By far the most dense striatal projection of the BR@@ 1 ( primary pherom@@ onal cortex ) is to the BR@@ 2 &#91; 242 &#93; , which also receives massive inputs from areas of cortex associated with the amygdala ( cortical nucleus and post@@ pir@@ iform transition and pir@@ iform @-@ amygdal@@ ar areas ) ( see &#91; 162 , 165 &#93; ) -- all of which in turn receive massive inputs from the main or accessory olfactory bulb &#91; 242 &#93; .
Per@@ haps the most dense striatal projections from the BR@@ 1 and adjacent posterior BR@@ 2 are to the central nucleus , which also gets heavy inputs from the amygdala @-@ related cortical regions just mentioned as projecting massi@@ vely to the medial amygdal@@ ar nucleus ( see &#91; 162 , 165 &#93; ) .

The medial and central nuclei send a dense GABAergic projection to the BR@@ 1 or rostral BR@@ 2 ( see &#91; 38 , 141 , 206 , 247 &#93; ) , and the medial nucleus also projects to all components of the rostral behavior control column except the descending paraventricular nucleus and dorsal pre@@ mamm@@ illary nucleus ( see &#91; 38 &#93; ) .
The medial and central nuclei send a dense GABAergic projection to the BR@@ 1 or rostral pallidum ( see &#91; 38 , 141 , 206 , 247 &#93; ) , and the medial nucleus also projects to all components of the rostral behavior control column except the descending paraventricular nucleus and BR@@ 2 ( see &#91; 38 &#93; ) .
The medial and central nuclei send a dense GABAergic projection to the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis or rostral BR@@ 1 ( see &#91; 38 , 141 , 206 , 247 &#93; ) , and the medial nucleus also projects to all components of the rostral behavior control column except the descending paraventricular nucleus and BR@@ 2 ( see &#91; 38 &#93; ) .

Multiple stri@@ at@@ op@@ all@@ idal targets of single cortical areas It is obvious from the literature that many cortical areas LW Sw@@ an@@ son / Brain Research 8@@ 86 ( 2000 ) 113 164 141 send a divergent projection to the BR@@ 1 , and that a more limited expan@@ se of cortex projects to the BR@@ 2 as well as the BR@@ 1 .

On the other hand , it is true that the circuitry associated with these four nuclei has special functional significance -- we would suggest that the BR@@ 1 is a striatal region specialized for rel@@ aying pherom@@ onal information to the ( hypothalamic ) motor system , whereas the BR@@ 2 is a striatal region specialized for rel@@ aying cortical information to the autonomic system &#91; 294 &#93; .
Conclusions Developmental , gene expression , connec@@ tional , and functional evidence conver@@ ges to suggest that the cerebral hemispheres have three basic parts -- cortex , BR@@ 1 , and BR@@ 2 -- and that they generate two major outputs , a triple casc@@ ading projection to the motor system on one hand and projections to thalamocortical feedback loops on the other .

A better way to approach understanding the cerebral hemispheres is to begin with a structure / function par@@ cel@@ ing of the cortical mantle , and then follow the organization of primary and secondary projections from this map through the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 ( Fig 20 ) .
Each cortical area displays a characteristic lamin@@ ation pattern ( compare primary visual and BR@@ 1 , for example ) , and this is reflected in structural differenti@@ ations of striatal and pall@@ idal regions influenced by that cortical area ( compare BR@@ 2 with olfactory tubercle , for example ) .

Basi@@ cally , we have presented evidence to support the generalization that at a minimum the cerebral hemispheres generate a triple projection to the motor system , with an excitatory component from the cortex , an inhibitory component from the BR@@ 1 , and a dis@@ inhibitory component from the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 14 ) .
The caudal segment includes the BR@@ 1 , reticular substantia nigra , and BR@@ 2 , and it appears to be involved in signaling or regulating the direction of head orientation , of orienting movements of the eyes , head , and upper limbs , and of locomotor activity -- in other words , key components of exploratory or foraging behavior in general By way of contrast , the rostral segment includes the medial preoptic , anterior hypothalamic , descending Fig 34 .

As reviewed elsewhere ( D@@ ong et al , 200@@ 1a ) , the BR@@ 1 corresponds by and large to the BR@@ 2 posterior lateral sub@@ nucleus , identified and named independently by M@@ oga et al ( 1989 ) .
The BR@@ 1 lies within the BR@@ 2 intermediate division of de Ol@@ mos et al ( 1985 ) , a scheme adopted by Pax@@ in@@ os and Watson ( 1986 ) ; within the BR@@ 2 intermediate column of Al@@ he@@ id et al ( 1995 ) , or posteriorly in the BR@@ 2 lateral division of Pax@@ in@@ os and Watson ( 1998 ) .

After the rostr@@ ally directed fibers just described leave the BR@@ 1 , they provide dense inputs to ventral stri@@ at@@ op@@ all@@ idal regions of the basal ganglia / BR@@ 2 , as well as light inputs to the lateral septal complex and medial prefrontal cortex ( Fig 3 ) .

Upon leaving the BR@@ 1 these fibers enter the caudal end of the BR@@ 2 , where they branch infrequently but generate abundant terminal boutons and boutons @-@ of@@ passage ( Fig@@ s 4E , 5A ) .
More rostr@@ ally , dor@@ s@@ ally , and laterally , innervation of the BR@@ 1 by the BR@@ 2 decreases very substantially ( Fig 4C , D ) .
A moderate number of labeled axons then turn ventr@@ ally , where they immediately branch and generate terminal boutons in ventromedial regions of the BR@@ 1 ( Fig 4C , D ) before entering the rostral half of the BR@@ 2 and continuing to branch and generate boutons ( Fig@@ s 4D , E , 5A ) .
Some of these axons then leave the rostral BR@@ 1 to end in the adjacent BR@@ 2 , where dense clusters of PH@@ AL @-@ labeled boutons were observed in all three layers ( Fig 4@@ CE ) .
A small number of other axons in the BR@@ 1 instead course medi@@ ally , rostr@@ ally , and dor@@ s@@ ally through the BR@@ 2 to end in the deeper layers of the infr@@ alim@@ bic and prelim@@ bic areas of the prefrontal cortex ( Fig 4@@ AD ) .
A very few axons associated with this branch of the rostral pathway were also observed in the ventral ten@@ ia tec@@ ta ( Fig 4B ) , medial BR@@ 1 ( Fig 4A ) , and dorsal BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4A , B ) .
In fact , rostr@@ ally directed axons from the BR@@ 1 extend ventr@@ ally into the BR@@ 2 directly from the region of the fusiform nucleus ( Fig@@ s 4G , H , 5B ) and anter@@ o@@ ventral area ( Fig 4@@ F ) , as well as from the nucleus accumbens ( Fig@@ s 4E , 5A ) , as mentioned above .

Most of these ventral fibers appear to extend laterally to enter a terminal field in medial regions of the striatal fundus ( see below and Fig@@ s 4@@ DI , 5A , B ) , or caud@@ ally to join the BR@@ 1 in the caudal half of the BR@@ 2 ( see below and Fig@@ s 2A , 4@@ EK , 5A , B ) .
For the sa@@ ke of convenience , these exceptionally complex projections involving more than 75 obvious terminal fields will be divided into those to the telencephalon ( which include local projections , a rostral projection , and ascending projections through the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 ) , and those to the brainstem and upper spinal cord ( which desc@@ end through the medial forebrain bundle , a ventral hypothalamic tract , and the periventricular system ) .

The rostral half of the BR@@ 1 ( Fig 4@@ CE ) is called the ventral BR@@ 2 by He@@ imer and colleagues ; they refer to the caudal half , which lies ventral to the globus pallidus ( dorsal BR@@ 2 ) , as the BR@@ 1 component of the extended amygdala ( see de Ol@@ mos and He@@ imer , 1999 ) .
Certain other axons from the BR@@ 1 in the caudal BR@@ 2 extend laterally instead of ventr@@ ally .
A distinct bundle of PH@@ AL @-@ labeled axons clim@@ bs dor@@ s@@ ally from injection sites in the BR@@ 1 to enter the BR@@ 2 and follow it to the amygdal@@ ar region ( Fig 4@@ IK ) .
However , a small terminal field was observed in a ventrolateral region of the BR@@ 1 just medial to the BR@@ 2 and adjacent to the caud@@ op@@ ut@@ amen at the level of the rostral tip of the lateral dorsal thalamic nucleus ( Fig 4@@ M , ar@@ row ) .

At about the level of the BR@@ 1 ( Fig 4@@ KM ) , it would appear that this massive fiber bundle spl@@ its into two components , with many fibers extending laterally into the amygdal@@ ar region and many others ( which lie medi@@ ally ) extending caud@@ ally through the BR@@ 2 .
In addition , a few axons from the BR@@ 1 extend through the BR@@ 2 into the lateral segment of the globus pallidus , where they extend caud@@ ally to join the an@@ sa pedunc@@ ularis ( Fig 4@@ IL ) .
In addition , a few axons from the BR@@ 1 extend through the internal capsule into the lateral segment of the globus pallidus , where they extend caud@@ ally to join the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ IL ) .
In addition , a few axons from the B@@ ST@@ r@@ h extend through the BR@@ 1 into the lateral segment of the globus pallidus , where they extend caud@@ ally to join the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ IL ) .
Thus , a dense , un@@ interrupted terminal field generated by the BR@@ 1 is observed in the restricted longitudinal zone of the BR@@ 2 illustrated in Fig@@ ures 4@@ EM and 6A .
First , at medial preoptic levels scattered PH@@ AL @-@ labeled axons with terminal boutons and boutons @-@ of @-@ passage extend medi@@ ally into the BR@@ 1 ( Fig 4@@ J ) and the immediately adjacent rostral tip of the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ K ) .
And third , near the caudal end of the BR@@ 1 a distinct bundle of axons turns medi@@ ally to enter the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ M ) .
Finally , in the caudal end of the BR@@ 1 these fibers merg@@ e with those descending through the BR@@ 2 ( see next section ) .
The vast majority of BR@@ 1 axons in the BR@@ 2 extend from the caudal substantia inn@@ om@@ in@@ ata into the amygdal@@ ar region , where a dense terminal field is formed in the central nucleus ; moderate terminal fields are formed in the anterior area , anterior cortical nucleus , 454 H @-@ W D@@ ON@@ G AND LW SW@@ AN@@ SON Fig 6 .

Throughout this region , scattered labeled axons extend from the medial BR@@ 1 across the BR@@ 2 and through the lateral , anterior basolateral , and posterior bas@@ omedial nuclei ( where few boutons were observed ) to enter the posterior basolateral nucleus ( Fig 4@@ OR ) .
BR@@ 1 axons may also reach the latter via the BR@@ 2 .
Thus , a few laterally directed axons course ventr@@ ally and caud@@ ally to end in the post@@ pir@@ iform transition , pir@@ iform , and lateral entorhinal areas ( Fig 4@@ R@@ X ) ; a few medi@@ ally directed axons with terminal boutons were found in the BR@@ 1 , lateral BR@@ 2 , ventral zone of the medial BR@@ 2 , and ventral region of hippocampal field CA1 ( Fig 4@@ OX ) .

Furthermore , along the length of the BR@@ 1 a few labeled axons from the BR@@ 2 cross the midline in the thalamic gray ( middle ) commissure .

Thus , light contralateral terminal fields were observed in the ventral tegmental and retro@@ ru@@ bral areas , the BR@@ 1 , and the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ V@@ HH ) .

Some labeled axons from the BR@@ 1 cross the midline in the commissural part of the nucleus of the solitary tract to enter the contralateral nucleus of the solitary tract and BR@@ 2 .
The results of these control experiments , while not conclusive , suggest that the overall pattern of projections from the sub@@ commissural zone and anterolateral area of the BR@@ 1 share many similarities with that of the BR@@ 2 .
First , through the rostral pathway inputs to the BR@@ 1 are much lighter from the sub@@ commissural zone and anterolateral area than from the BR@@ 2 , whereas projections to the striatal fundus are heavier from the sub@@ commissural zone than from the BR@@ 2 .
Fourth , the anterolateral area and sub@@ commissural zone innervate the mesencephalic nucleus of the BR@@ 1 much less densely than does the BR@@ 2 .
Fif@@ th , as compared to the BR@@ 1 , the sub@@ commissural zone and anterolateral area send only light projections to the lateral division ( including the waist area ) of the BR@@ 2 and moderate projections to the medial division .
Six@@ th , a particularly interesting difference is that the anterolateral area and sub@@ commissural zone do not send clear inputs to the BR@@ 1 and caudal BR@@ 2 and their input to the par@@ vic@@ ellular reticular nucleus is also much less than that from the B@@ ST@@ r@@ h .

For@@ tun@@ ately , literature on neural outputs of the BR@@ 1 per se is quite limited because in the past most connec@@ tional research dealt with larger regions of the BR@@ 2 as a whole .
Previous literature With the few exceptions considered below , there is little direct corrobor@@ ation of our results in earlier anterograde tracing analyses because they were not concerned with projections from individual BR@@ 1 cell groups and so used R@@ HO@@ MB@@ O@@ ID PRO@@ JEC@@ TIONS relatively large injection sites that for our purposes appear simply to spread to include at least part of the BR@@ 2 , along with a number of other BR@@ 1 differenti@@ ations ( Con@@ rad and Pf@@ aff , 1976 ; Sw@@ an@@ son and Cow@@ an , 1979 ; van der Ko@@ o@@ y et al , 1984 ; Hol@@ ste@@ ge et al , 1985 ) .
Nevertheless , the broad outlines of the major pathways followed by BR@@ 1 outputs , and by the outputs from many other parts of the BR@@ 2 , are apparent in these articles .

Retrograde tracer experiments in the rat ( Su@@ n and Cas@@ sel , 1993 ) and cat ( Rus@@ sch@@ en , 1982 ) first indicated a projection from the general region of the BR@@ 1 containing the BR@@ 2 to the central nucleus .
Our results also indicate that the BR@@ 1 massi@@ vely innerv@@ ates the caudal BR@@ 2 and adjacent ventral tip of the lateral or external globus pallidus , on its way to the amygdal@@ ar region .

The most substantial known direct input to the BR@@ 1 arises in the BR@@ 2 ( Su@@ n et al , 1991 ; D@@ ong et al , 200@@ 1a ) and it is complemented by local inputs to the BR@@ 1 from the jux@@ tac@@ apsular , oval , and fusiform nuclei , sub@@ commissural zone , and anterolateral area of the B@@ ST ( D@@ ong et al , 2000 , 200@@ 1b ) , which also receive massive central nucleus inputs ( Su@@ n et al , 1991 ; D@@ ong et al , 200@@ 1a ) .
The most substantial known direct input to the B@@ ST@@ r@@ h arises in the BR@@ 1 ( Su@@ n et al , 1991 ; D@@ ong et al , 200@@ 1a ) and it is complemented by local inputs to the B@@ ST@@ r@@ h from the jux@@ tac@@ apsular , oval , and fusiform nuclei , sub@@ commissural zone , and anterolateral area of the BR@@ 2 ( D@@ ong et al , 2000 , 200@@ 1b ) , which also receive massive central nucleus inputs ( Su@@ n et al , 1991 ; D@@ ong et al , 200@@ 1a ) .
Regions of BR@@ 1 projecting directly to the central nucleus include primary gustatory and visceral areas , secondary main BR@@ 2 ( mostly in the amygdal@@ ar region ) , visceral association areas ( in the agran@@ ular insular region ) , medial prefrontal areas , and ventral sub@@ icul@@ um ( see Mc@@ Don@@ ald , 1998 ) .

Anatomical evidence suggests that certain BR@@ 1 regions also project directly to the anterolateral area , including the BR@@ 2 .
&quot; In fact , they arise from a major subset of the cortical regions that directly innervate the central nucleus , including the primary gustatory and visceral areas ( see Mc@@ Don@@ ald et al , 1999 ) ; secondary main olfactory system @-@ related parts of the amygdal@@ ar region , including the anterior bas@@ omedial and posterior basolateral &quot; &quot; nuclei &quot; &quot; and the BR@@ 1 ( see D@@ ong et al , 200@@ 1a ) ; visceral association areas in the agran@@ ular insular region ( see Mc@@ Don@@ ald et al , 1999 ) ; and the BR@@ 2 of prefrontal cortex ( see Mc@@ Don@@ ald et al , 1999 ) . &quot;

Limited anatomical evidence suggests that the BR@@ 1 region is innervated by locus coeruleus noradrenergic axons ( Pic@@ kel et al , 1974 ; Jones and Y@@ ang , 1985 ) , dorsal raphe serotonergic axons ( Ver@@ tes , 1991 ) , and BR@@ 2 , presumably dopaminergic axons ( Mo@@ ore , 1978 ; Bec@@ k@@ stead et al , 1979 ; H@@ ok@@ felt et al , 1980 ; H@@ as@@ ue and Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h @-@ Lag@@ n@@ ado , 2002 ) .

They include the central amygdal@@ ar nucleus ( Hop@@ kins and Hol@@ ste@@ ge , 1978 ; Tak@@ eu@@ chi et al , 1988 , 1991 ; G@@ on@@ z@@ ales and Ch@@ ess@@ el@@ et , 1990 ; V@@ ank@@ ova et al , 1992 ) , striatal fundus ( Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h @-@ Lag@@ n@@ ado et al , 2001 ) , BR@@ 1 ( Gro@@ ene@@ we@@ gen and Rus@@ sch@@ en , 1984 ; B@@ eren@@ d@@ se et al , 1992 ; I@@ w@@ ata et al , 1996 ) , BR@@ 2 ( Sw@@ an@@ son et al , 1984 ; Gro@@ ve , 198@@ 8@@ b ; Gro@@ ene@@ we@@ gen et al , 1993 ) , and ventral regions of the lateral globus pallidus ( von K@@ ro@@ sig@@ k et al , 1992 ; Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h @-@ Lag@@ n@@ ado et al , 1996 ) .
L@@ icking , chewing , and swallowing require precise coordination with respiratory activity and the BR@@ 1 projects strongly to the lateral part of the BR@@ 2 that projects directly to the phrenic nucleus ( see Cohen , 1979 ; Bi@@ anch@@ i and Gre@@ lot , 1994 ) .
The BR@@ 1 projects moderately to one part of the rostral behavior control column , the descending paraventricular nucleus , and one part of the caudal , the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 fusiform nucleus , which receives a substantial local input from the BR@@ 2 , also innerv@@ ates the descending paraventricular nucleus ( D@@ ong et al , 200@@ 1b ) .
The BR@@ 1 , along with parts of the ventral stri@@ at@@ op@@ all@@ idum ( the BR@@ 2 and substantia inn@@ om@@ in@@ ata ) that project massi@@ vely to it , are components of a well @-@ established system that controls locomotor or exploratory behavior , as well as some aspects of the accompanying expectation of reward ( see M@@ ogen@@ son , 1987 ; Gro@@ ene@@ we@@ gen et al , 1996 ; Kal@@ iv@@ as and N@@ ak@@ am@@ ura , 1999 ; Z@@ ah@@ m et al , 1999 ; Sch@@ ult@@ z , 2000 ; Sw@@ an@@ son , 2000 ) .
The BR@@ 1 , along with parts of the ventral stri@@ at@@ op@@ all@@ idum ( the nucleus accumbens and BR@@ 2 ) that project massi@@ vely to it , are components of a well @-@ established system that controls locomotor or exploratory behavior , as well as some aspects of the accompanying expectation of reward ( see M@@ ogen@@ son , 1987 ; Gro@@ ene@@ we@@ gen et al , 1996 ; Kal@@ iv@@ as and N@@ ak@@ am@@ ura , 1999 ; Z@@ ah@@ m et al , 1999 ; Sch@@ ult@@ z , 2000 ; Sw@@ an@@ son , 2000 ) .
The ventral tegmental area , along with parts of the ventral stri@@ at@@ op@@ all@@ idum ( the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 ) that project massi@@ vely to it , are components of a well @-@ established system that controls locomotor or exploratory behavior , as well as some aspects of the accompanying expectation of reward ( see M@@ ogen@@ son , 1987 ; Gro@@ ene@@ we@@ gen et al , 1996 ; Kal@@ iv@@ as and N@@ ak@@ am@@ ura , 1999 ; Z@@ ah@@ m et al , 1999 ; Sch@@ ult@@ z , 2000 ; Sw@@ an@@ son , 2000 ) .
There is good evidence to suggest that the BR@@ 1 ( see Str@@ at@@ ford and Kel@@ ley , 1999 ) and BR@@ 2 ( see R@@ ol@@ ls et al , 1986 ) play a role in feeding behavior .
The BR@@ 1 massi@@ vely innerv@@ ates a region of BR@@ 2 that includes the paraventricular , intermedi@@ odorsal , and medial medi@@ odorsal nuclei ; they in turn project to a rather extensive band of cortex that includes the anterior cingulate area , prelim@@ bic and infr@@ alim@@ bic areas of the prefrontal region , agran@@ ular insular area , per@@ ir@@ h@@ inal area of the ventral temporal region , and entorhinal area and ventral sub@@ icul@@ um of the hippocampal formation ( see Gro@@ ene@@ we@@ gen , 1988 ; B@@ eren@@ d@@ se and Gro@@ ene@@ we@@ gen , 1991 ; R@@ isol@@ d et al , 1997 ) .

The highest accumulation of PAC@@ AP@@ containing nerve cell and nerve fibers was found in the BR@@ 1 , indicating a possible role of PACAP in many autonomic functions , covering light entrainment of circadian rhythms , stress regulation , water and electro@@ lytic homeostasis , hormone secretion , feeding , reproduction , temperature regulation , and sleep / arousal The demonstration of PACAP in many limbic areas and nuclei receiving sensory information as well as the expression in the cortex and BR@@ 2 suggests that PACAP participates in various functions within the CNS .
PACAP @-@ IR cell bodies were also found in the BR@@ 1 ( S@@ ol ) and in the BR@@ 2 ( 10 ) .

PACAP may be a neurotransmitter within the olfactory bulb , but the findings of PACAP immunoreactivity in limbic areas receiving olfactory information , such as the BR@@ 1 , the amygdala , and the bed nucleus of the BR@@ 2 , could suggest that PACAP is a neurotransmitter in an integrative circuit between olfactory sensation and reproductive behavior .

In@@ dex@@ ing terms : prefrontal cortex ; hippocampus ; hypothalamus ; amygdala ; theta rhythm The nucleus re@@ uni@@ ens ( BR@@ 1 ) is the largest of the midline nuclei of the thalamus and is the major source of thalamic afferents to the BR@@ 2 and para@@ hippocampal structures , including the entorhinal cortex ( W@@ ou@@ ter@@ lo@@ od et al , 1990 ; W@@ ou@@ ter@@ lo@@ od , 1991 ) .
RE stimulation was shown to produce large @-@ amplitude population responses ( field excitatory postsynaptic potentials and spikes ) at BR@@ 1 , that is , comparable to those elicited by stimulation of BR@@ 2 .
&quot; This thalam@@ o@@ hippocampal connection bypasses the tris@@ ynaptic / commissural pathway that has been thought to be the exclusive excitatory drive to CA1 . &quot; &quot; Although BR@@ 1 is a major input to the BR@@ 2 ( HF ) and one of the few direct routes to HF , very few studies have examined afferent projections to RE in Gr@@ ant spon@@ sor : National Institute of Mental Health ; Gr@@ ant number : MH@@ 6@@ 35@@ 19 ; Gr@@ ant number : MH@@ 0@@ 14@@ 76 . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ menting on this , R@@ isol@@ d et al ( 1997 ) stated that &quot; &quot; very little work has been done on inputs to the nucleus re@@ uni@@ ens , and even less has been done on connections relative to putative sub@@ nuclei . &quot; &quot; Our interest in RE stems in part from our previous demonstr@@ ations that the BR@@ 1 ( SU@@ M ; J@@ T M@@ CK@@ EN@@ NA AND RP V@@ ER@@ TES Ver@@ tes , 1992 ) and the posterior nucleus of the BR@@ 2 ( PH ; Ver@@ tes et al , 1995 ) send pronounced projections to RE . &quot;

&quot; This pattern is consistent with previous results ( Her@@ ken@@ ham , 1979 ; S@@ ak@@ ai et al , 1998 ; Des@@ bo@@ is and V@@ ill@@ anu@@ ev@@ a , 2001 ; K@@ ha et al , 2001 ) as well as the inclusion of BR@@ 1 as part of the &quot; &quot; motor BR@@ 2 &quot; &quot; ( Pr@@ ice , 1995 ; K@@ ha et al , 2001 ; J@@ el@@ j@@ eli et al , 2003 ) . &quot;

Compared with rostral parts , the caudal RE receives much stronger projections from several regions of the cortex ( AG@@ m , dorsal AC , BR@@ 1 , BR@@ 2 , ec@@ tor@@ h@@ inal and per@@ ir@@ h@@ inal cortices ) , from the reticular nucleus of thalamus , and from the inter@@ pedunc@@ ular nucleus ( IP ) .

Specifically , BR@@ 1 , BR@@ 2 , RT , and IP essentially do not project to RE@@ r .
&quot; On the other hand , RE@@ r receives considerably heavier inputs than RE@@ c from most subcortical &quot; &quot; limbic &quot; &quot; regions of the basal forebrain , di@@ encephalon , and brainstem , including BR@@ 1 , A@@ HN , V@@ MH , PH , SU@@ M , and PAG , as well as from the hippocampus ( BR@@ 2 / sub@@ icul@@ um ; see Table 1 ) . &quot;

Compared with RE@@ r / RE@@ c , the ro@@ stro@@ lateral RE ( RE@@ r@@ l ) receives 1 ) den@@ ser and more diverse projections from the basal forebrain , including the lateral septum , BR@@ 1 , BR@@ 2 , LPO , MPN / MPO , and medial and cortical nuclei of the amygdala ; 2 ) roughly equivalent projections from the medial prefrontal cortex and regions of the caudal di@@ encephalon / rostral midbrain , including Z@@ I , PH , SU@@ M , pre@@ tectum , and di@@ encephalic PAG ; and 3 ) far fewer projections from A@@ HN , V@@ MH , LH@@ y , all nuclei of the brainstem , excluding the par@@ abr@@ achial complex , and from the hippocampus .

By contrast , however , with the present findings , Her@@ ken@@ ham ( 1978 ) described considerably fewer cells in all commonly labeled sites and failed to demonstrate labeling in several structures reported here , prominently including the insular and retro@@ splen@@ ial cortices , BR@@ 1 , per@@ ifor@@ n@@ ical / lateral BR@@ 2 , lateral pre@@ tectum ( APN , PPT ) , NPC , COM / PCO , and mono@@ aminergic nuclei of the brainstem .
These included pronounced projections from mPFC , ventral BR@@ 1 , rostral part of the lateral septum , Z@@ I , BR@@ 2 ( A@@ HN , V@@ MH , PH , and PM@@ d ) , and brainstem ( mainly , MPT , PAG , and par@@ abr@@ achial nuclei ) .
We observed moderate to dense projections to RE from a relatively widespread region of the basal forebrain , that is , dor@@ s@@ ally from deep layers of the dorsal tan@@ ia tec@@ ta ( BR@@ 1 ) and BR@@ 2 , ventr@@ ally from SI and DB@@ h , and to a lesser extent from the medial and lateral preoptic areas ( Table 1 , Fig 14 ) .

Unlike the case for several other regions of the brain , afferents to RE from other nuclei of the BR@@ 1 were rather limited , predominantly originating from the paraventricular , reticular , and ventral division of the lateral geniculate nucleus ( LG@@ v ) and the BR@@ 2 .
Ar@@ lu@@ ison and D@@ ere@@ r ( 1993 ) reported that PV fibers distribute to ventromedial parts of the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 , including RE , whereas M@@ oga et al ( 1995 ) , using PHA @-@ L , described similar findings .
They proposed that LG@@ v / IG@@ L afferents to the midline BR@@ 1 ( mainly to PV , BR@@ 2 , and RE ) modulate suprachiasmatic inputs to these sites in the regulation of visu@@ omotor and circadian pacema@@ king activity ( Mo@@ ore et al , 2000 ) .
Although R@@ isol@@ d et al ( 1997 ) ca@@ uti@@ ously suggested that Z@@ I projections to RE essentially target only the rostral RE , we found that injections throughout the extent of RE produced strong retrograde labeling in Z@@ I . BR@@ 1 . Unlike the BR@@ 2 , the hypothalamus is a major source of input to RE .
The BR@@ 1 ( PM@@ d ) lies rostral to the BR@@ 2 in the caudal di@@ encephalon ( Can@@ ter@@ as and Sw@@ an@@ son , 199@@ 2b ; Sw@@ an@@ son , 1998 ) .
&quot; Notably , other sites with elevated fos were structures with significant input to RE ( mPFC , BR@@ 1 , A@@ HN , V@@ MH , and BR@@ 2 ; Fig 14 ) , suggesting that information related to various aspects of &quot; &quot; defense &quot; &quot; may be rou@@ ted through RE . &quot;
138 Supporting the present results , we previously showed that the BR@@ 1 ( SU@@ M ) and the posterior nucleus ( PH ) of the BR@@ 2 strongly target RE ( Ver@@ tes , 1992 ; Ver@@ tes et al , 1995 ) .
We demonstrated pronounced projections to RE from several structures of the brainstem , including the BR@@ 1 ( PCO ) , PAG , pre@@ tectum , SC , dorsal and median raphe nuclei , BR@@ 2 , and LD@@ T .
&quot; With respect to return SC projections to the forebrain ( or , specifically , SC input to the midline BR@@ 1 ) , K@@ rou@@ t et al ( 2001 ) speculated that &quot; &quot; the SC @-@ thalamic pathway supplies sensory information to higher brain centers that participate in tasks such as escape , freezing and orientation responses , &quot; &quot; and , further , that these projections may transmit &quot; &quot; the spatial location and possibly the salience of unexpected events occurring in the external environment to cortical , striatal and amygdaloid sites . &quot; &quot; BR@@ 2 , LD@@ T , P@@ PN , MR , DR , LC , IN@@ C , NTS , and pontine and mesencephalic RF . &quot;
Specifically , they postulated that pherom@@ onal information is transmitted from olfactory structures ( and from bas@@ omedial amygdala ) to nuclei of the medial BR@@ 1 ( mainly to A@@ HN , V@@ MH , PH , and PM@@ d ) and from there to RE and to the BR@@ 2 ( AM ) of thalamus .
Specifically , they postulated that pherom@@ onal information is transmitted from olfactory structures ( and from bas@@ omedial amygdala ) to nuclei of the medial BR@@ 1 ( mainly to A@@ HN , V@@ MH , PH , and PM@@ d ) and from there to RE and to the anter@@ omedial nucleus ( BR@@ 2 ) of thalamus .

Regions expressing both high levels of NT@@ S3 / sor@@ tilin mRNA and protein also included several neocortical areas , the islands of C@@ alle@@ ja , medial and lateral septal nuclei , amygdaloid nuclei , thalamic nuclei , the BR@@ 1 , the substantia nigra , and the Purkinje cell layer of the BR@@ 2 In the brainstem , all cranial nerve motor nuclei were strongly labeled .
Other areas ( eg , hippocampal BR@@ 1 fields , BR@@ 2 , and cranial nerve motor nuclei ) , however , are NT @-@ negative , suggesting that NT@@ S3 / sor@@ tilin also exerts functions unrelated to NT signaling .
Furthermore , in situ hybridization studies revealed that the brain ( and most specifically the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 ) is the main location of NT@@ S3 / sor@@ tilin expression during mouse embryonic development ( Her@@ man@@ s @-@ B@@ org@@ me@@ yer et al , 1999 ) .
Reference areas for scoring labeling densities were the BR@@ 1 for background levels ( ) and the BR@@ 2 of the hypothalamus for the highest in situ hybridization signal ( ) .
Reference areas for scoring labeling densities were the BR@@ 1 for background levels ( ) and the supraoptic nucleus of the BR@@ 2 for the highest in situ hybridization signal ( ) .

In keeping with these results , NT@@ S3 @-@ immunopositive glial cells corresponding in morphology to oligodendrocytes were found in the same structures as illustrated for the BR@@ 1 ( Fig 3C ) , the lateral olfactory tract ( Fig 4C ) , and the BR@@ 2 ( see Fig 10@@ C ) .
In detail , the olfactory cortex , namely pir@@ iform and prep@@ ir@@ iform cortices , BR@@ 1 , dorsal BR@@ 2 , ta@@ enia tec@@ ta , and olfactory tubercle including the islands of C@@ alle@@ ja all displayed moderate to high in situ hybridization signal ( Fig 4@@ AC ; Table 1 ) .

The entorhinal cortex showed high signal intensity , whereas the pre and BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 ( DG ; Fig 7A ) exhibited only low hybridization signal , although a number of neurons in the hil@@ us of the DG were clearly labeled ( Table 1 ; Fig 7A , ar@@ ro@@ whe@@ ads ) .
The entorhinal cortex showed high signal intensity , whereas the pre and BR@@ 1 and the dentate gyrus ( BR@@ 2 ; Fig 7A ) exhibited only low hybridization signal , although a number of neurons in the hil@@ us of the BR@@ 2 were clearly labeled ( Table 1 ; Fig 7A , ar@@ ro@@ whe@@ ads ) .
The entorhinal cortex showed high signal intensity , whereas the pre and paras@@ ub@@ icul@@ um and the BR@@ 1 ( BR@@ 2 ; Fig 7A ) exhibited only low hybridization signal , although a number of neurons in the hil@@ us of the BR@@ 2 were clearly labeled ( Table 1 ; Fig 7A , ar@@ ro@@ whe@@ ads ) .
Similarly , the entorhinal cortex , pre and BR@@ 1 , A@@ mm@@ ons horn , and BR@@ 2 all showed NT@@ S3 / sor@@ tilin immunoreactivity .
B : In addition to somat@@ odend@@ ritic localization , immunoreactivity was found in axons or axon terminals in a number of regions such as the periaqueductal BR@@ 1 ( PAG ) or the BR@@ 2 Termin@@ als frequently had the appearance of varicosities ( ar@@ rows ) connected in a pear@@ l chain @-@ like fashion by inter@@ varicose axonal segments of constant diameter ( ar@@ ro@@ whe@@ ads ) .

S@@ iz@@ eable numbers of NT@@ S3 / sor@@ tilin @-@ immunopositive neurons were also present in the arcuate and periventricular nuclei , BR@@ 1 , BR@@ 2 , and mamm@@ illary bodies ( Table 1 ) .
By contrast , the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 exhibited weak immunolab@@ eling ( Table 1 ) .
In the BR@@ 1 , the BR@@ 2 displayed moderate hybridization signal , whereas the medial hab@@ en@@ ula was not labeled ( Table 1 ) .
In the BR@@ 1 , the lateral hab@@ en@@ ula displayed moderate hybridization signal , whereas the BR@@ 2 was not labeled ( Table 1 ) .
In the epith@@ al@@ am@@ us , the BR@@ 1 displayed moderate hybridization signal , whereas the BR@@ 2 was not labeled ( Table 1 ) .
Similarly , by immunocytochemistry , sparse to moderate labeling of perikarya and fibers was observed in the BR@@ 1 , and the BR@@ 2 was virtually devoid of immunoreactivity except for very sparse fiber labeling ( Fig 9@@ A , Table 1 ) .
In the mes@@ encephalon , the BR@@ 1 was most strongly labeled by in situ hybridization , although other structures such as the neighboring BR@@ 2 expressed NT@@ S3 / sor@@ tilin mRNA at significant levels as well ( Table 1 , Fig 11@@ A ) .
Other nuclei exhibiting si@@ ze@@ able hybridization signal included the substantia nigra pars comp@@ ac@@ ta , the BR@@ 1 , the oc@@ cul@@ omotor nucleus , the dorsal raphe nucleus , the superior and inferior coll@@ iculi , and the BR@@ 2 ( Table 1 ) .
The substantia nigra , pars comp@@ ac@@ ta ( Fig 11C ) , the BR@@ 1 , the BR@@ 2 , and the inferior colliculus also displayed numerous , intensely immunoreactive neurons ( Table 1 ) .
The substantia nigra , pars comp@@ ac@@ ta ( Fig 11C ) , the BR@@ 1 , the oculomotor nucleus , and the BR@@ 2 also displayed numerous , intensely immunoreactive neurons ( Table 1 ) .

In addition , the BR@@ 1 , BR@@ 2 , periaqueductal gray , superior colliculus , and mesencephalic V all displayed moderate to medium numbers of NT@@ S3 / sor@@ tilin @-@ positive somata .
In addition , the BR@@ 1 , pre@@ commissural nucleus , BR@@ 2 , superior colliculus , and mesencephalic V all displayed moderate to medium numbers of NT@@ S3 / sor@@ tilin @-@ positive somata .
In addition , the ventral tegmental area , BR@@ 1 , BR@@ 2 , superior colliculus , and mesencephalic V all displayed moderate to medium numbers of NT@@ S3 / sor@@ tilin @-@ positive somata .
In the BR@@ 1 , the BR@@ 2 , nucleus of the trapez@@ oid body , median raphe nucleus , and motor and principal sensory trigeminal nuclei all showed medium NT@@ S3 / sor@@ tilin mRNA levels ( Table 1 ) .

All sub@@ fields of A@@ mm@@ ons horn ( CA@@ 13 ) display extremely high levels of hybridization signal Some labeled cells are also evident in the hil@@ us of the BR@@ 1 ( BR@@ 2 ; ar@@ ro@@ whe@@ ads ) , whereas the BR@@ 2 granule cell layer itself is only f@@ ain@@ tly labeled .

The BR@@ 1 , BR@@ 2 . and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus were also positive but more lightly labeled ( Table 1 ) .
The medi@@ odorsal nucleus ( BR@@ 1 ) exhibits the same staining pattern as the BR@@ 2 .
Dor@@ s@@ ally , the BR@@ 1 ( L@@ Hb ) shows very f@@ aint labeling of sparse neuronal cell bodies and processes , whereas the BR@@ 2 ( M@@ Hb ) is essentially devoid of immunoreactivity .
Electron microscopic distribution in the BR@@ 1 Electron microscopy confirmed the localization of NT@@ S3 / sor@@ tilin immunoreactivity to Purkinje cells in the BR@@ 2 .
C : Following immunolab@@ eling , densely packed large NT@@ S3 / sor@@ tilin @-@ positive cells can be found in the BR@@ 1 ad@@ joining the BR@@ 2 .
Thus , as documented here for NT@@ S3 / sor@@ tilin , Sor@@ LA was found to be highly expressed in pyramidal cells of cortical layer V , in the hippocampal BR@@ 1 fields and granule cell layer of the BR@@ 2 , and in cerebellar Purkinje cells ( Her@@ man@@ s @-@ B@@ org@@ me@@ yer et al , 1998 ) .
Sor@@ CS@@ 1 mRNA and immunoreactivity were localized to cortical layers III and V , the globus pallidus , dopaminergic BR@@ 1 nuclei , pontine nuclei , and deep nuclei of the BR@@ 2 ( Her@@ me@@ y et al , 200@@ 1a , b ) .
