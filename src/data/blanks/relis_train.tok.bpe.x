Connec@@ tions of the BR@@ 1 with BR@@ 2 in the rat .
The present study was undertaken to establish the precise anatomical relationship of the BR@@ 1 with BR@@ 2 in the rat .
The results of these tracing experiments confirm the general notion of reciprocal connections between the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
The reciprocal projection from this BR@@ 1 to BR@@ 2 appears to be very sparse .
The BR@@ 1 s@@ ends a very sparse projection back to the BR@@ 2 .
The projections of the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 appear also to be top@@ ographically organized .
In addition , a number of BR@@ 1 fibers reach the midbrain BR@@ 2 .
These findings suggest a role for the BR@@ 1 in non@@ motor functions of the BR@@ 2 .
Ser@@ oton@@ inergic and noradrenergic projections to the BR@@ 1 of the monkey BR@@ 2 .
The midbrain BR@@ 1 was the major site of origin for neurons providing a seroton@@ inergic projection to the BR@@ 2 .
The are@@ al and laminar distributions of the projection from the BR@@ 1 were studied in BR@@ 2 of the cat with the anterograde tracing method by using wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase .
In BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 , the projection fibers terminate in the superficial half of layer I and in the full portions of layers III and IV , forming double bands .
The present results demonstrate that the BR@@ 1 fibers terminate in a localized fashion in both the BR@@ 2 and that these W @-@ cell projections are quite unique in their are@@ al and laminar organization compared with the X@@ - and Y @-@ cell systems .
Synap@@ t@@ ology of the direct projections from the BR@@ 1 to BR@@ 2 of the rat .
During the pharyngeal phase of the swallowing reflex , the BR@@ 1 receives peripheral inputs from the pharynx by means of the BR@@ 2 and is the location of premotor neurons for the pharyngeal motoneurons .
We investigated whether the neurons in the BR@@ 1 projected directly to the pharyngeal motoneurons or to the other kinds of neurons in the BR@@ 2 by using the electron microscope .
Observations of serial ultrathin sections revealed that both the small and the medium @-@ sized neurons received only a few labeled ax@@ osomatic terminals that were exclusively Gray &apos;s type I. These results indicate that the BR@@ 1 neurons may send mainly inhibitory as well as a few excitatory inputs directly to the BR@@ 2 .
The region of the BR@@ 1 is a major target of dehydration @-@ sensitive CRH neurons in the rat BR@@ 2 .
Although labelled fibers from these injections were seen throughout the brain , the region of the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 were most conspicuous in also having corticotropin @-@ releasing hormone immunoreactive fibers .
These results strongly suggest that the BR@@ 1 activated by cellular dehydration provide an input to the region of the BR@@ 2 .
Stri@@ atal and central extended BR@@ 1 parts of the BR@@ 2 : evidence from tract @-@ tracing techniques in the rat .
The BR@@ 1 lies at the junction of the stri@@ at@@ op@@ all@@ idal system and the BR@@ 2 ( i.@@ e .
Our anterograde tracing experiments reveal that the projections of the BR@@ 1 largely reciproc@@ ate its afferent connections and are very similar to those of the BR@@ 2 .
Local connections are found within BR@@ 1 and within BR@@ 2 , but the two divisions are not interconnected .
Eff@@ eren@@ t BR@@ 1 projections of the BR@@ 2 in the rhesus monkey .
In the BR@@ 1 , labeling was found in the BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 inputs define a caudal component of the BR@@ 2 in primates .
The BR@@ 1 mediates goal @-@ directed behavior through BR@@ 2 afferents .
However , BR@@ 1 also receive inputs from the BR@@ 2 .
There are also BR@@ 1 inputs to calcium binding protein -positive areas outside the shell , which originate mainly in the BR@@ 2 .
Role of the BR@@ 1 in the control of blood pressure : descending pathways to BR@@ 2 .
Electron microscopic studies using combined anterograde tracing and pre- and post @-@ embedding immunogold labelling have shown that the pathways originating from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 are inhibitory and may use GABA as a neurotransmitter .
The results of these studies suggest that blood pressure changes produced by activation of the BR@@ 1 may be mediated by attenuation of baroreceptor reflexes through a GABAergic mechanism at the level of the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 , homolog of the primate BR@@ 2 , modulates circadian rhythms .
Here , BR@@ 1 -@@ efferent pathways are identified with the anterograde tracer , Phaseolus vulgaris leuc@@ o@@ agglutinin , with projections to over 50 BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 also receives projections from the BR@@ 2 and may contribute to both sleep / arousal and visu@@ omotor function .
The mammalian BR@@ 1 receives input from all BR@@ 2 and provides extensive projections to the central nervous system .
BR@@ 1 in the rat : projections to BR@@ 2 .
This paper describes the quantitative are@@ al and laminar distribution of identified neuron populations projecting from areas of BR@@ 1 to BR@@ 2 in the rat .
High @-@ resolution flat @-@ map density distributions of retrogradely labelled neurons indicated that specific BR@@ 1 regions were differentially involved in the projections studied , with BR@@ 2 divided into dorsal and ventral sectors .
Compar@@ able data for the BR@@ 1 show that this nucleus plays critical roles in the pupillary light reflex , light @-@ evoked blin@@ ks , rapid eye movement sleep triggering , and modulating BR@@ 2 involved in circadian rhythms .
Our investigation shows that the primate BR@@ 1 receives both direct and indirect projections from BR@@ 2 .
They divide as they enter the BR@@ 1 , the so @-@ called BR@@ 2 .
The indirect cortico@@ striatal projection derives from a thin collateral emitted within the BR@@ 1 by thick , long @-@ range fibers that desc@@ end toward the BR@@ 2 .
The collateral enters the BR@@ 1 dorsome@@ di@@ ally and remains un@@ branched until it reaches the BR@@ 2 , where it breaks out into two to four axonal branches displaying small and equally spaced varicosities .
Both direct and indirect cortico@@ striatal axons branch moderately but occupy vast BR@@ 1 , where they appear to contact en pass@@ ant several widely distributed BR@@ 2 neurons .
The 11 @-@ beta @-@ hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 neurons do not innervate the BR@@ 1 , a key BR@@ 2 autonomic site .
Ultrastructural organization of BR@@ 1 inputs to the BR@@ 2 .
Consistent with this , there are direct BR@@ 1 projections to the BR@@ 2 .
However , the significance of the latter projection remains unclear because no data are available regarding the BR@@ 1 targets of BR@@ 2 axons .
In these two BR@@ 1 , BR@@ 2 axon terminals only formed asymmetric synapses , typically with gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid -@@ immun@@ onegative spines but occasionally with dendritic profiles , half of which were gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid immunopositive .
In the light of earlier observations , these findings indicate that BR@@ 1 inputs exert mainly excitatory effects in the BR@@ 2 , pre@@ valently on principal neurons .
The stimulation sites ( BR@@ 1 &#91; L @-@ ST@@ G &#93; and BR@@ 2 &#91; L @-@ IPL &#93; ) , modality of targets , and task were manipulated independently .
The observed double dissociation suggests that the conscious task instruction modulates the stimulus @-@ driven activation of the BR@@ 1 for lex@@ ico @-@ phonological activation and the BR@@ 2 for spoken word production , and thereby eng@@ ages a different neural network for generating the appropriate behavioral response .
T@@ op @-@ down control of BR@@ 1 ensembles by BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 might alter neuronal activity in areas such as BR@@ 2 to inhibit temporally inappropriate responses .
We then reversibly inactivated BR@@ 1 while recording ensemble activity in BR@@ 2 .
Inactivation of BR@@ 1 reduced delay @-@ related firing , but not response @-@ related firing , in BR@@ 2 .
These data suggest that functional interactions between BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 might serve as a top @-@ down control signal that inhibits inappropriate responding .
Patterns of cortical label were related to myelo@@ architecture in sections cut parallel to the surface of flattened BR@@ 1 , and to BR@@ 2 processed for cytochrome oxidase .
BR@@ 1 revealed a caud@@ oro@@ str@@ al series of myelin dense ov@@ als in BR@@ 2 that represent the periodontal receptors of the contralateral teeth , the contralateral tongue , the ipsilateral teeth , and the ipsilateral tongue .
Al@@ do@@ sterone @-@ sensitive neurons of the BR@@ 1 : multi@@ synaptic pathway to the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 is part of a BR@@ 2 system implicated in reward , motivation , and learning .
Defic@@ its in short @-@ latency tracking eye movements after chemical lesions in monkey BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .

Multi@@ sensory convergence in BR@@ 1 , I. Cortical connections of the c@@ BR@@ 2 in macaque monkeys .
The BR@@ 1 has anatomical and physiological features consistent with its role as a first @-@ stage BR@@ 2 .
A companion paper describes the BR@@ 1 connections of BR@@ 2 ( H@@ ac@@ ket@@ t et al . , J. Com@@ p .
As expected , connections with adjacent BR@@ 1 were stronger than connections with BR@@ 2 .
Taken together , the findings indicate that BR@@ 1 may receive somatosensory input from nearby areas along the BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 stimulation and neuronal activity in the BR@@ 2 in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
During stimulation of the subthalamic ( BR@@ 1 ) stimulation at 14 @-@ Hz , no change in either the mean firing rate or the discharge pattern of BR@@ 2 neurons was observed .
stimulation of the subthalamic ( BR@@ 1 ) stimulation at 140 @-@ Hz decreased the mean firing rate by 64 % and the mean duration of bursting mode activity of BR@@ 2 neurons by 70 % .
The BR@@ 1 residual neuronal activity during 140 @-@ Hz stimulation of the subthalamic ( BR@@ 2 ) stimulation was driven by the stimulation of the subthalamic stimulation .
How the decrease in rate and modification of firing pattern with evoked neuronal activity of BR@@ 1 neurons during high frequency stimulation of the subthalamic ( BR@@ 2 ) stimulation contribute to the improvement of Parkinson@@ ian motor disability remains to be elucidated .
Neuronal degeneration and reorganization : a mutual principle in pathological and in healthy interactions of BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
Based on developmental principles and insights from animal research about neuro@@ plasticity in cell assemblies , this article is to propose a view of plasticity that promotes a link between BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 structure and function .
Both the mitotic activity in BR@@ 1 and the maturation of dopamine fibres in the BR@@ 2 proved to be a measurable combination for investigating the complex chain of events that relate activity dependent neuro@@ plasticity to normal as well as to pathological matur@@ ational processes .
In the BR@@ 1 , where ontogenetic plasticity proved to be preserved by continued neuro@@ - and synapt@@ ogenesis , serious damage can be internalized without simultaneous disruption of neural dynamics offering an approach to reverse dysfunctional reorganization in the BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 projections from the whis@@ ker @-@ sensitive regions of the BR@@ 2 in the rat .
This study investigated the axonal projections of whis@@ ker @-@ sensitive cells of the BR@@ 1 ( BR@@ 2 ) in rat oral , inter@@ polar , and caudal divisions .
Two types of ascending fibers arise from SP@@ 5@@ i : Type I fibers are thick and distribute to the BR@@ 1 and to other regions of the BR@@ 2 , i.@@ e .
Type II fibers are thin ; branch spar@@ sely in the BR@@ 1 ; and form small @-@ sized , b@@ ush@@ y arb@@ ors in the BR@@ 2 .
Cortico@@ fu@@ gal connections between the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 in the rat .
The distribution of BR@@ 1 efferent connections to the BR@@ 2 was quantitatively analyzed by means of retrograde axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase , wheat germ agglutinin @-@ horseradish peroxidase , and Fast Blue in rats .
Eff@@ eren@@ t projections of the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 in the rat .
In this study , BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 efferent projections were compared by using anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris @-@ leuc@@ o@@ agglutinin and retrograde transport of Fluoro@@ Gold .
Top@@ ographic organization of BR@@ 1 inputs to the lateral nucleus of the macaque monkey BR@@ 2 : a retrograde tracing study .
In the BR@@ 1 , retrogradely labeled cells were most numerous in the rostral portion of the BR@@ 2 .
Although retrograde tracers can provide only limited evidence for topography , we nonetheless noted that the density of retrogradely labeled cells in a BR@@ 1 reliably depended on the location of the tracer injection in the BR@@ 2 .
Top@@ ographic projection from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 of the bar@@ n owl .

Bi@@ ocy@@ tin injected into the superficial layers of the BR@@ 1 labelled bout@@ on @-@ laden axons in the BR@@ 2 .
These axons were generally fin@@ er than , but had similar bout@@ on densities as , feed @-@ forward auditory fibers in the BR@@ 1 , labelled by injections of bi@@ ocy@@ tin into the BR@@ 2 .
Sub@@ cortical projections of BR@@ 1 ( BR@@ 2 ) of the macaque monkey .
In several species , including primates , stimulation studies indicate that the BR@@ 1 , the most caudal part of the BR@@ 2 , functions as a visceral motor region .
To determine the BR@@ 1 projections of this region in primates , injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leuko@@ agglutinin , biotinylated dextran amine , or rhodamine @-@ labeled dextran amine were placed in BR@@ 2 in three monkeys .
BR@@ 1 terminal fields of individual axons from the BR@@ 2 in Macaca mul@@ atta .
This study examined organization of the projection from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 in Macaca mul@@ atta .
The distribution of all contralateral terminal fields in the BR@@ 1 was char@@ ted , and representative individual axons that terminated in the BR@@ 2 were traced in serial sections under the light microscope .
The results reveal a complex organization of the input from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 that only partially fits into the traditional concept of somat@@ otopic organization of the nucleus .
BR@@ 1 projections to the BR@@ 2 in the hamster .
Specific anatomical subdivisions of the BR@@ 1 receive taste afferent input and contain interneurons and projection neurons that engage ascending or BR@@ 2 taste pathways .
cholera toxin B was injected into the BR@@ 1 to label , by retrograde transport , the sources of BR@@ 2 inputs .
Intram@@ edullary cholera toxin B labeling after BR@@ 1 injection indicates that the rostral central subdivision also receives projections from the BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 projections to distinct longitudinal columns of the BR@@ 2 in the rat .
We utilised retrograde and anterograde tracing procedures to study the origin and termination of BR@@ 1 projections to the BR@@ 2 in the rat .
A previous study , in the primate , had demonstrated that distinct subgroups of BR@@ 1 areas project to specific BR@@ 2 columns .
An@@ ter@@ ograde tracing experiments revealed that the projections to different BR@@ 1 columns arose from specific BR@@ 2 areas .
As well , consistent with the retrograde data , projections arising from select BR@@ 1 terminated selectively in the BR@@ 2 .
We show that the nucleus receives inputs from several widely distributed areas in the BR@@ 1 and , to a much lesser extent , from the BR@@ 2 as well .
Overall , the present analysis helps to delineate BR@@ 1 circuits seemingly critical for the organization of innate fear responses to environmental threats , where the BR@@ 2 presents a major associative role .
Furthermore , by means of massive inputs from the BR@@ 1 , the BR@@ 2 is in a position to integrate information from a neural system involved in spatial working memory , which may be of particular relevance for an effect of attentional mechanisms on the selection of appropriate escape strategies .
Only BR@@ 1 projected to the BR@@ 2 , and this projection as small .
Connec@@ tions between the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 in the Japanese monkey .
The connections between the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 were examined in the Japanese monkey by means of retrograde and anterograde tract @-@ tracing methods with wheat germ agglutinin @-@ conjugated horseradish peroxidase and fluorescent dyes .
Each of these BR@@ 1 was reciproc@@ ally connected with the entire ro@@ stro@@ caudal extent of BR@@ 2 .
In the BR@@ 1 , labeled cells were located in BR@@ 2 ( i .
near the BR@@ 1 ) , but not in BR@@ 2 ( i.@@ e .
The BR@@ 1 in direct reciprocal connection with BR@@ 2 were presumed to be involved in the memory system , especially in the system for declar@@ ative memory .
BR@@ 1 connected with the BR@@ 2 in a Mad@@ ag@@ as@@ can hedgehog ten@@ re@@ c .
The most prominent input to the BR@@ 1 originated from the BR@@ 2 .
An exception was the BR@@ 1 , which was poorly connected with the BR@@ 2 .
However , there was an BR@@ 1 , which could be differentiated from the BR@@ 2 by its intense reaction to NAD@@ Ph @-@ diaphorase .
The variability of cell populations and BR@@ 1 connections shown here may help to clarify both phylogenetic relationships and the significance of individual basal BR@@ 2 subdivisions .
Mon@@ osynaptic projections from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 in the rhesus monkey : implications for voc@@ alization and reproductive behavior .
In the accompanying study , the BR@@ 1 and its BR@@ 2 projections have been identified in the rhesus monkey .
The present light and electron microscopical tracing study describes the BR@@ 1 - BR@@ 2 pathway in primates .
In one of these three monkeys , biotinylated dextran amine and cholera toxin subunit b were injected into the BR@@ 1 to retrogradely identify BR@@ 2 neurons .
The results show that a compact group of neurons in the BR@@ 1 at the inter@@ coll@@ icular level s@@ ends a dense projection to the BR@@ 2 .
It is concluded that there exists a strong and direct BR@@ 1 - BR@@ 2 pathway in the rhesus monkey .
Neuro@@ transmitters contained in the BR@@ 1 inputs to the monkey BR@@ 2 .
Auditory information from the BR@@ 1 reaches the BR@@ 2 by way of two pathways : a direct thalam@@ o @-@ amygdala projection and a poly@@ synaptic thalam@@ o @-@ cortico @-@ amygdala projection .
Furthermore , the extent and topographical distribution of bifur@@ c@@ ating cells that project to both BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 are also unknown .
There are no apparent differences in the size , shape , or density of terminal special@@ izations in BR@@ 1 or BR@@ 2 , and , consistently with previous double @-@ labeling experiments , some axons can branch to both areas .
The retro@@ splen@@ i@@ oc@@ oll@@ icular connection is of interest because it constitutes one link between the BR@@ 1 , which is considered the anatomical substrate of emotional experience , and the BR@@ 2 , which mediates approach and avoidance behavior .
Terminal fields originating in BR@@ 1 were preferentially distributed in BR@@ 2 , respectively , but there were also large , densely innervated regions in which the terminal fields overlapped .
Flu@@ oro @-@ Gold injections in the BR@@ 1 confirmed the retro@@ splen@@ i@@ oc@@ oll@@ icular topography and demonstrated that this connection originated from layer V pyramidal cells of all BR@@ 2 .
The present results demonstrate that the BR@@ 1 is the origin of a broad and dense network of axonal branches that may modulate BR@@ 2 -mediated motor and physiological responses involved in emotional behavior .
The results support the subdivision of the BR@@ 1 into &quot; medial &quot; and &quot; orbital &quot; networks and suggest that the pre@@ fron@@ to@@ striatal projections reflect the functional organization of the BR@@ 2 rather than topographic location .
In part of a closer investigation of cor@@ ti@@ coh@@ ippocamp@@ al systems , the authors applied single @-@ axon analysis to the connections from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 .
For 4 axons , branches were followed to BR@@ 1 and to the border between the BR@@ 2 , raising the suggestion that these areas , which sometimes are viewed as serial stages , are tightly interconnected .
BR@@ 1 connections in turtles with special reference to the BR@@ 2 : a h@@ od@@ ological and gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid @-@ immunohistochemical study .
Comparison of these findings with previous work on other species reveals striking similarities between the BR@@ 1 pathway in turtles and birds and in the BR@@ 2 pathway in turtles , birds , and mammals .
Cortico@@ striatal projections from focal sites in both BR@@ 1 exhibited substantial amounts of divergence within the BR@@ 2 .
We found that the proportion of overlapping projections to the BR@@ 1 was moderately correlated with the amount of overlap observed in the BR@@ 2 .
Pro@@ jec@@ tions from the BR@@ 1 to BR@@ 2 in neon@@ atally deaf@@ ened cats .
In the present study , anatomical projections from the BR@@ 1 to BR@@ 2 were investigated in normal adult cats and in animals that were neon@@ atally deaf@@ ened with the ot@@ otoxic drug amikacin .
However , retrograde tracer injections into different regions of BR@@ 1 produced a normal pattern of labeling in the BR@@ 2 .
In both experimental and control animals , the main mass of labeled BR@@ 1 cells was found in the BR@@ 2 v .
Different iso@@ frequency contours in BR@@ 1 receive input from different portions of the BR@@ 2 v .
The relatively normal thalamocortical projection pattern suggests that , after neonatal BR@@ 1 lesions , the major reorganization of cochle@@ otopic maps occurs at BR@@ 2 levels .
Organization of projections from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 in the rat .
The detailed organization of projections from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 of the rat was studied by using anterograde tracing .
The interstitial cell groups receive BR@@ 1 afferents from the BR@@ 2 and from the dorsomedial cell column .
A medi@@ olateral topography was noted in the projections from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 .
Pro@@ jec@@ tions from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 were found to follow a basically ro@@ stro@@ caudal topography .
Its ro@@ stro@@ medial parts are directed to the BR@@ 1 and its caud@@ olateral part reach the BR@@ 2 .
Study of projections from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 of the rat .
This excitatory input is most likely derived from axons that branch as they pass through the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 .
These structures are thought to play differential roles in higher @-@ order discriminative and homeostatic ( BR@@ 1 ) versus BR@@ 2 .
After BR@@ 1 injections , approximately 18 % of the Fos @-@ like immunoreactive neurons were double @-@ labeled ; after BR@@ 2 injections the proportion was 9 % .
On the other hand , regardless of stimulus , twice as many Fos @-@ like immunoreactive neurons projected to the BR@@ 1 as to the BR@@ 2 .
A plausible hypothesis for reconc@@ iling this apparent discrepancy is that many Fos @-@ like immunoreactive neurons make local projections in BR@@ 1 , that in turn give rise to BR@@ 2 connections .
Relationship between BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 neurons in lam@@ pre@@ ys .
Some afferents showed large , bulb @-@ like enlarg@@ ements and about 20 of these were found in the BR@@ 1 , whereas about 40 were found in the BR@@ 2 .
In addition , BR@@ 1 with bulb @-@ like enlarg@@ ements in apparent contact with BR@@ 2 neurons were trans@@ neur@@ onally labeled by bi@@ ocy@@ tin .
This anatomical organization suggests that afferents carrying bulb @-@ like enlarg@@ ements convey dynamic information to BR@@ 1 , which , in turn , project to the BR@@ 2 networks .
BR@@ 1 mon@@ osyn@@ ap@@ tically innervate extran@@ uclear noradrenergic dendrites in the rat BR@@ 2 .
Previous reports using light microscopy have provided anatomical evidence that neurons in the BR@@ 1 innervate the medial peric@@ o@@ erul@@ ear dendrites of noradrenergic neurons in the BR@@ 2 .
The present study used anterograde tracing and electron microscopic analysis to provide more definitive evidence that neurons in the BR@@ 1 form synapses with the somata or dendrites of noradrenergic BR@@ 2 neurons .
Ultrastructural analysis of anter@@ ogr@@ ad@@ ely labeled terminals at the levels of the rostral and caudal subdivisions of the BR@@ 1 indicated that approximately 20 % of these form synapses with tyrosine hydroxylase @-@ immunoreactive dendrites ; most of these were located in the BR@@ 2 .
These results provide direct evidence for mon@@ osynaptic projections from neurons in the BR@@ 1 to the extran@@ uclear dendrites of noradrenergic BR@@ 2 neurons .
In contrast , injections centered in the neighboring BR@@ 1 revealed inputs mainly from BR@@ 2 , consistent with previous studies .
Both BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 projections course in diffuse pathways .
Extensive overlap was observed between the targets of these BR@@ 1 fibers and those of the secondary efferent projections of the BR@@ 2 , though the latter were more numerous and reached additional targets .
Trac@@ er application to the BR@@ 1 also revealed a number of bul@@ b@@ op@@ etal neurons in the BR@@ 2 , as well as crossed inter@@ bulbar projections .
The presence in a chondro@@ ste@@ an of important BR@@ 1 projections and their extensive overlap with BR@@ 2 projections suggest that such projections are a derived characteristic of bony fishes .
BR@@ 1 projections to midline and BR@@ 2 of the rat .
The projections from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 were examined in the rat .
The BR@@ 1 received an input only from the BR@@ 2 .
Finally , the waist area of the BR@@ 1 was densely labeled after cholera toxin @-@ beta injections in the BR@@ 2 .
In addition , the developmental changes observed involve both reductions in the total number of BR@@ 1 neurons and a differential loss of BR@@ 2 projections .
In series of experiments it was shown that the focus of exciting neurons , forming the descending singular @-@ autonomic discharge is localized in the BR@@ 1 of BR@@ 2 .
In another series of micro@@ electrophysiological experiments it was shown downward blocking inhibitory influence of BR@@ 1 on activity of vagal viscer@@ osensory neurons of BR@@ 2 .
Within the BR@@ 1 , 60 % of the projecting activated cells were catecholaminergic , as were 59 % of such cells in the BR@@ 2 .
This suggests that oxytocin and vasopressin neurons within the BR@@ 1 are stimulated at parturition via afferent inputs from the BR@@ 2 , but the input is not exclusively noradrenergic .
Aff@@ eren@@ ts to the BR@@ 1 and functional subdivisions of the BR@@ 2 : neuroanatomical substrates for affective behavior .
Our laboratory has shown that electrical stimulation of the BR@@ 1 versus the BR@@ 2 , in the rabbit , elicits two distinct behavioral / cardiorespiratory response patterns .
Separate retrograde tracers were injected into functional subdivisions of the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 in rabbits .
Although double @-@ labeled cells were never observed , afferents to the BR@@ 1 were often proximal to BR@@ 2 afferents .
Cortico@@ striatal projections from focal sites in both BR@@ 1 exhibited substantial amounts of divergence within the BR@@ 2 .
We found that the proportion of overlapping projections to the BR@@ 1 was moderately correlated with the amount of overlap observed in the BR@@ 2 .
Relative distribution of synapses in the BR@@ 1 of the cat : implications regarding the &quot; driver / modulator &quot; theory of BR@@ 2 function .
To provide a quantitative comparison of the synaptic organization of &quot; first @-@ order &quot; and &quot; higher @-@ order &quot; BR@@ 1 , we followed bias @-@ corrected sampling methods identical to a previous study of the cat BR@@ 2 ( d@@ LGN ; Van Hor@@ n et al . &#91; 2000 &#93; J. Com@@ p .
However , in comparison to the BR@@ 1 , the BR@@ 2 receives significantly fewer numbers of RL , F1 , and F2 contacts and significantly higher numbers of RS contacts .
Thus , the RS / RL synapse ratio in the BR@@ 1 is 24 : 1 , in contrast to the 5 : 1 RS / RL synapse ratio in the BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 is part of the electro@@ motor co@@ roll@@ ary discharge pathway , and its projection to BR@@ 2 suggests a feedback loop .
K@@ it@@ t and Bra@@ uth &#91; 1981 &#93; Neuro@@ science 6 : 15@@ 51 @-@ 15@@ 66 ) and adjacent BR@@ 1 can be subdivided into several distinct sub@@ areas that are chemically comparable to mammalian BR@@ 2 structures .
The BR@@ 1 is the@@ orized to be homologous to the BR@@ 2 .
The apparent counterpart in bud@@ ger@@ ig@@ ars of the mammalian BR@@ 1 consists of a field of cholinergic neurons spanning the BR@@ 2 .
The bud@@ ger@@ ig@@ ar BR@@ 1 is the@@ orized to be homologous as a field to the mammalian BR@@ 2 .
The function of the cortic@@ ogen@@ iculate feedback pathway from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 in primates is not well understood .
Pressure injections of biotinylated dextran were made into owl monkey BR@@ 1 , and the resulting labeled axons were reconstructed through serial sections of the BR@@ 2 .
Unlike cortic@@ ogen@@ iculate axons seen in the cat , cortic@@ ogen@@ iculate axons in the owl monkey maintained topographic innervation in the BR@@ 1 layers that was consistent with receptive field sizes represented in BR@@ 2 .
The distribution of retrogradely labeled neurons showed no clear segregation along the BR@@ 1 ; they were usually located along the entire BR@@ 2 .
For all BR@@ 1 , there was a general trend of the labeled neurons to occupy the BR@@ 2 along the dor@@ so@@ ventral axis .
The same territories were labeled after injection in BR@@ 1 , but in addition numerous labeled neurons were found in the most BR@@ 2 .
At higher resolution , however , there was clear evidence that the territories projecting to BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 formed separate , interdig@@ itating , clusters along the dor@@ so@@ ventral axis .
A comparable local segregation was observed for the two subdivisions of BR@@ 1 , whereas there was more local overlap among the BR@@ 2 .
Ax@@ onal sprouting of a BR@@ 1 @-@ BR@@ 2 pathway after estrogen administration in the adult female rhesus monkey .
BR@@ 1 projections to the BR@@ 2 are species specific and might be involved in mating behavior .
In the female cat , this behavior is estrogen dependent , and estrogen induces axonal sprouting in the BR@@ 1 -@@ BR@@ 2 pathway .
The effect of estrogen was studied on the BR@@ 1 -@@ l@@ BR@@ 2 projection with the use of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as a tracer in six adult ovariectomized rhesus monkeys with or without estrogen priming .
Light microscopy showed that the density of arbor@@ izing labeled BR@@ 1 axons in the BR@@ 2 was greater in estrogen @-@ treated than in control animals .
The results showed that estrogen induces axonal sprouting in a BR@@ 1 @-@ BR@@ 2 pathway in the adult female rhesus monkey .
These findings supported the concept that the BR@@ 1 -@@ BR@@ 2 pathway may be involved in sexual behavior .
Moreover , they demonstrated that a long descending BR@@ 1 @-@ BR@@ 2 tract in adult nonhuman primates retains the capacity for axonal sprouting .
Origin of the dopaminergic innervation of the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 shell : a combined retrograde tracing and immunohistochemical study in the rat .
By using an anti @-@ dopamine serum , BR@@ 1 projections to BR@@ 2 were confirmed to be in part dopaminergic .
A small number of cells sent collateral projections to the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
The double @-@ labeled cells constituted fewer than 2 % of the cells that projected to the BR@@ 1 or to the BR@@ 2 .
The results indicate that the synaptic organization of Gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid -positive profiles in the BR@@ 1 nucleus is very similar to that in other BR@@ 2 .
Especially the dopaminergic cells , located in the BR@@ 1 ( BR@@ 2 c ) , are of great neurologic interest , because the functional deficit and depletion of these cells are the correlate of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
We used a combination of in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry on sections of human postmortem BR@@ 1 to investigate the expression of GABA receptor subunit messenger RNAs and of the receptor protein in dopaminergic BR@@ 2 cells .
This might represent a negative feedback loop between the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 c and be a target of pharmacologic interventions in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson &apos;s disease .
Relationships between the BR@@ 1 component of blin@@ king and the BR@@ 2 were studied in rats .

This is the first study using anti @-@ protein gene product 9.5 immunolab@@ eling and confocal microscopy on thick sections to examine systematically the terminal arbor@@ izations of the various BR@@ 1 endings and to compare them between two species , the rat and the cat , that have similar @-@ appearing BR@@ 2 but different exploratory behaviors , such as existence or absence of whis@@ king .
Otherwise , the inner conical body of rat BR@@ 1 contains en pass@@ ant , circum@@ feren@@ tially oriented l@@ ance@@ olate endings that are lacking in the cat , whereas the BR@@ 2 of the cat has en pass@@ ant corpuscular endings that are lacking in the rat .

In this study , we made restricted injections of Neuro@@ biotin , which labeled small sectors of the BR@@ 1 , to study the projections of BR@@ 2 fibers representing a narrow band of frequencies .
Two injections spaced &amp; gt ; or = 2 mm apart in the BR@@ 1 resulted in labeled bands of projecting axons in the BR@@ 2 that were 53 % broader than would be expected if they were proportional to those in adults , and the two projections were incompletely segregated in the youngest animals studied .
Pro@@ jec@@ tions to the BR@@ 1 were 32 % broader in neonates than in adults when normalized , but the BR@@ 2 projections were always discrete , even at the earliest ages studied .

These bands of fasc@@ icles are divided along the midline in a &quot; zone of reorganization &quot; to create two full maps of the BR@@ 1 surface ; however , this map is discontinuous in that BR@@ 2 are adjacent to one another .
In the BR@@ 1 , axons undergo another reorganization such that BR@@ 2 axons shift position and become localized laterally and ventr@@ ally , whereas centrally placed axons become localized dor@@ s@@ ally .

Indeed , the presence of at least some normal BR@@ 1 targets seems necessary for the formation of BR@@ 2 connections .
These data are consistent with the idea that ectopic BR@@ 1 projections develop by sprouting of axon collaterals in response to signals arising from the deafferen@@ ted nucleus , and that these axons compete with other sets of axons for terminal space in the BR@@ 2 .
Par@@ valbumin is expressed in a reciprocal circuit linking the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 in the rabbit .

However , the bulk of the BR@@ 1 fibers appeared to terminate in the BR@@ 2 and exhibited a discrete dor@@ so@@ ventral topographical pattern .
The terminal plexus displayed patches of uneven density , which was partly due to the numerous fiber bundles passing through the BR@@ 1 , but also to an obvious preference of BR@@ 2 fibers for some cells .

We did not observe changes in neurofilament expression in BR@@ 1 or in BR@@ 2 in the contexts of hearing song or sing@@ ing , although these contexts result in marked induction of the transcription factor Z@@ EN@@ K .
This observation suggests that neurofilament might not be under the regulatory control of Z@@ EN@@ K in BR@@ 1 or in BR@@ 2 .
Two other imprinting @-@ related areas , the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 , do show c @-@ fos induction ; however , the areas are not congru@@ ous with those demarc@@ ated by the 2 @-@ DG autoradiographic studies .

A@@ vul@@ sion of a part of the BR@@ 1 has similar effects as destruction of the BR@@ 2 .
Gal@@ anin @-@ positive synapses were most prominent on choline acetyltransferase @-@ positive neurons in the BR@@ 1 and in the BR@@ 2 , which is where there was the greatest overlap between the distribution of galanin @-@ immunoreactive terminals and choline acetyltransferase @-@ positive neurons .

Ser@@ oton@@ inergic fibers have been reported in both the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 of the cat .
To resolve the issue of whether these two populations of neurons overlap , seroton@@ inergic fibers were assayed in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 ; then the morphologies and distributions of identified seroton@@ inergic neurons and oculomotor inter@@ nuclear neurons were determined .
Following injection of horseradish peroxidase into either the BR@@ 1 or BR@@ 2 , double @-@ label immunohistochemical techniques demonstrated that the seroton@@ inergic and oculomotor inter@@ nuclear neurons form two distinct cell populations .

Ev@@ oked potentials to auditory click @-@ train stimulation presented bin@@ aur@@ ally were recorded chronically from penetrating electrodes implanted in BR@@ 1 , from pial @-@ surface electrodes placed on the BR@@ 2 , or from both simultaneously , in awake humans undergoing surgery for medically intractable epilepsy .
Ev@@ oked potentials recorded simultaneously from BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 differed in their sensitivities to general anesthesia and to changes in rate of stimulus presentation .

It seems likely that the strong physiological correlates of soma size which have been described among cat BR@@ 1 ganglion cells and among the relay cells of the macaque BR@@ 2 are generally present in primates .
At the BR@@ 1 , ganglion cells are smaller in soma size than in BR@@ 2 ; they also seemed more uniform in size , although some distinctly larger cells persist in the human and b@@ ush@@ baby .
Thus the primate BR@@ 1 examined show features , such as the BR@@ 2 specialization , which seem unique to them among mammals .
Morphology of thalamocortical neurons projecting to the BR@@ 1 and their relationship to BR@@ 2 terminals in the squirrel monkey .
Additionally , connectivity was analyzed in seven rats in which BR@@ 1 and / or BR@@ 2 projections to the area were labeled anter@@ ogr@@ ad@@ ely with either 3H @-@ leucine or wheat @-@ germ agglutinin conjugated to HRP , and the animals were perfused and processed following various histological procedures .
BR@@ 1 and cortico@@ thalamic afferents originating from the host were observed in the ne@@ onucle@@ us when the fetal neurons had been implanted correctly into the lesioned area but not when they had been mis@@ placed into either normal BR@@ 2 tissue or the internal capsule .
These results are discussed with regard to the normal cyto@@ architecture and connectivity of the BR@@ 1 of the rat BR@@ 2 .
D@@ l@@ x@@ 3 expression then resol@@ ves to the BR@@ 1@@ t and gradually becomes limited to the BR@@ 2 by stage 30 .
A pair of long visual fibers projects from each BR@@ 1 of the BR@@ 2 of the dr@@ agon@@ fly Sym@@ pe@@ tr@@ um .
Nerv@@ ous is an autosomal recessive mutation in mice that produces a progressive BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 degeneration .
Following injections of horseradish peroxidase or wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase into the BR@@ 1 , midbrain BR@@ 2 were processed with a combined procedure that allowed visualization of both the retrograde tracer and one or more antigens including glutamate , glutaminase , and glutam@@ atic acid decarboxylase .
The dendritic fields of 8@@ 40 BR@@ 1 ganglion cells labeled by injections of horseradish peroxidase into the BR@@ 2 or optic tracts of normal cats .
In all regions of BR@@ 1 more that 0.5 mm from the area centr@@ alis the dendritic fields of BR@@ 2 ganglion cells are oriented radi@@ ally , i.@@ e .
In an effort to determine how BR@@ 1 cells are generated and spatially organized within BR@@ 2 regenerated after ouabain injection , in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical techniques were combined with computational analyses of two @-@ dimensional spatial patterns of identified neurons .
The spatial patterns of inner BR@@ 1 neurons in experimental eyes were also disorganized with respect to native BR@@ 2 .
Subsequent to this time , labeling of Mul@@ ler cells is significantly more robust , resulting in Mul@@ ler cell dom@@ ination of BR@@ 1 autoradiographic patterns in more mature BR@@ 2 .
We conclude that the ability of BR@@ 1 cells to accumulate 3H @-@ GABA does not remain constant during postnatal development ; rather each cell population displays a unique maturation sequence that results in a dramatic developmental shift in the number and types of GABA @-@ accumulating cells present in the BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 lesions resulted in a partial loss of 3H @-@ nicotine binding in BR@@ 2 .
In each BR@@ 1 lesion group , the greatest decrease occurred within the BR@@ 2 and area ( i.@@ e .
S@@ aturation analysis , performed in BR@@ 1 tissue homogenates following BR@@ 2 lesions , revealed a significant reduction in receptor density but not affinity .
Direct excitotoxic lesions of the BR@@ 1 ( BR@@ 2 ) tended to preserve 3H @-@ nicotine binding in layers 3 / 4 , despite local neuronal loss .
This organizing principle appears to apply not only to sensory and motor relay projections but also to BR@@ 1 that project to BR@@ 2 .
Pro@@ jec@@ tions to contralateral ganglia , the BR@@ 1 , and the BR@@ 2 were also examined .
Coun@@ ts of labelled neurons yielded estimated tot@@ als of 1,@@ 700 @-@ 1,@@ 800 BR@@ 1 and 400 @-@ 500 BR@@ 2 efferent neurons .
Effects of estrogen replacement therapy on cholinergic BR@@ 1 neurons and BR@@ 2 cholinergic innervation in young and aged ovariectomized rhesus monkeys .
The present study tested the hypothesis that estrogen enhances the phenotype of cholinergic BR@@ 1 neurons and their BR@@ 2 cholinergic innervation in young adult and aged ovariectomized rhesus monkeys .
These data indicate that estrogen administered in a manner simulating natural hormonal cycl@@ icity produces modest age @-@ specific chemical phenotypic and regional changes in select neuronal sub@@ fields of the cholinergic BR@@ 1 and their BR@@ 2 projection sites in nonhuman primates .
In the adult rat BR@@ 1 , perine@@ ur@@ onal nets are found around large , BR@@ 2 neurons and Golgi neurons and are composed of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans , tenascin @-@ R , hyaluronan , and link proteins , such as cartilage link protein 1 .
Significantly greater numbers of activated neurons expressing the Neuro@@ peptide FF gene were observed in the BR@@ 1 at the level of the BR@@ 2 in animals receiving intracerebroventricular ( i.@@ c.@@ v .
Whereas the two latter areas contain dense terminal networks , the BR@@ 1 is occupied primarily by 5 @-@ HT fibers en route to other parts of the BR@@ 2 .
Where fluorescent retrograde tracing was performed with 5 @-@ HT immunohistochemistry on the same tissue section , a prominent 5 @-@ HT containing pathway and a non @-@ 5 @-@ HT @-@ containing pathway from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 were revealed .
In this study , we examined whether the chloramphenicol enhancement of deafferen@@ tation @-@ induced cell death reveals the same ultrastructural characteristics that are seen in degenerating BR@@ 1 neurons after BR@@ 2 removal alone .
The percentage of BR@@ 1 neurons displaying ribosomal disintegration following BR@@ 2 removal was found to be markedly increased after chloramphenicol treatment .
In the BR@@ 1 of mice homozygous for the BR@@ 2 degeneration slow gene , receptor outer segments failed to develop and typical disc structures were never observed .
At the time when outer segments grew in the normal BR@@ 1 , the BR@@ 2 in the mutant showed an accumulation of membrane @-@ bound vesicles of varying size and density .
The distribution of catecholaminergic and cholinergic neurons in the BR@@ 1 of the ferret were mapped by staining immunohistochemically two adjacent series of sections of BR@@ 2 for tyrosine hydroxylase and choline acetyltransferase , respectively .
Ch@@ oline @-@ acetyltransferase @-@ positive neurons distributed in the BR@@ 1 ( BR@@ 2 ) are smaller than the cholinergic cells of Ch@@ 5 , and they stain less intensely for choline acetyltransferase .
Ca@@ ud@@ ally , the BR@@ 1 neurons extend some considerable extent into the BR@@ 2 .
In conclusion , the ferret has a typically carni@@ v@@ ore pattern for the distribution of catecholaminergic cells in the BR@@ 1 , and there is a significant overlap between the catecholaminergic and cholinergic cell groups in the BR@@ 2 .
Re@@ presentation pattern in the BR@@ 1 of the monkey BR@@ 2 .
The digits , hand , and arm are represented posterior to the face and may take up the BR@@ 1 in the region immediately in front of the BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 and on the BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 each project to BR@@ 2 , and their projections appear to converge within the representation of a given body part .
There are cal@@ retin@@ in @-@ IR cells in the BR@@ 1 and throughout the BR@@ 2 .
To determine the types , we doubly immunolab@@ eled BR@@ 1 , from BR@@ 2 to periphery , for cal@@ retin@@ in @-@ IR in combination with other calcium binding proteins and inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters .
Developmental changes in the spatial pattern of BR@@ 1 neuron populations in the developing chick BR@@ 2 .
According to detailed qualitative observations BR@@ 1 neurons appear as a primitive unique population along a thin BR@@ 2 .
According to quantitative analyses , the definitive spatial pattern of BR@@ 1 neurons results from a process of differential cell movements along the tangential plane of the BR@@ 2 .
The mesenchymal population appears as an out@@ si@@ der subset of neurons that migrate from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 .

Some sources of BR@@ 1 input to the opos@@ sum BR@@ 2 were identified by retrograde horseradish peroxidase and anterograde autoradiographic methods .
The BR@@ 1 projection exhibited a definite spatial organization and included all except the most BR@@ 2 .
Most prominent S@@ lack immunoreactivity occurs in the BR@@ 1 , in particular the trigeminal system and BR@@ 2 , where very intense staining was found in both cell bodies and axonal fibers of associated nuclei .
Within the BR@@ 1 , the BR@@ 2 had a robust signal consistent with staining of the giant presynaptic terminals .
The only BR@@ 1 in which S@@ lack immunoreactivity was detected was the BR@@ 2 .
gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid ergic bipolar cells in the BR@@ 1 , a BR@@ 2 devoted to feedback in the electro@@ sensory system , project in relatively diffuse fashion to pyramidal cells .
To understand the functional relevance of the BR@@ 1 as a major distrib@@ ut@@ or of BR@@ 2 processed information , detailed information about its neuronal organization is necessary .
Because all four different regions of the BR@@ 1 share this paucity of collater@@ alized projections , we conclude that BR@@ 2 outputs generally originate as parallel projections .
The BR@@ 1 of lizards is a three @-@ layered brain region displaying cyto@@ - and chemo@@ architec@@ ton@@ ical , connec@@ tional , and ontogenetic characteristics that relate it to the BR@@ 2 of mammals .

Cytochrome oxidase was histochemically localized in the normal BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 of goldfish in order to examine the laminar and cellular oxidative metabolic organization of these structures .
In SF@@ GS@@ d , intense reactivity was found to occur specifically within a class of large diameter axons and terminals that were apparently BR@@ 1 since these were also labeled with HRP and cobal@@ t@@ ous lysine applied to the BR@@ 2 .
Like the large diameter BR@@ 1 terminals in SF@@ GS@@ d , the large ganglion cells were preferentially filled with HRP , suggesting that they may project to BR@@ 2 and are the source of the dar@@ kly reactive large diameter axons and terminals in sub@@ lamina SF@@ GS@@ d .
Mos@@ sy fiber ingrowth into the BR@@ 1 suprag@@ ran@@ ular layer was assessed in the BR@@ 2 at 2- and 4 months post@@ lesion by measuring both the average width and the relative density of spro@@ uted terminals .
Morphometric modifications associated with early sensory experience in the rat BR@@ 1 : I. Vol@@ u@@ metric study of the BR@@ 2 layers .
Following complete sensory deprivation , the volume of all BR@@ 1 layers , except the periventricular core , was homogeneously reduced along the BR@@ 2 .
The most intense immunolab@@ eling occurred in a population of liquor @-@ contacting cells , located around the BR@@ 1 , which extended processes to the dorsal , lateral , and ventral margins of the BR@@ 2 .
A moderate level of taurine immunoreactivity was also present in ependymal cells , located around the BR@@ 1 , as well as in astrocytes throughout all regions of the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 projection to the BR@@ 2 in the pigeon .
The BR@@ 1 of the pigeon receiving direct vestibular afferents was delineated by anterograde transport of &#91; 3H &#93; -@@ amino acids injected into the BR@@ 2 .
A few solitary labelled rosettes were also found in more BR@@ 1 , as well as in the BR@@ 2 .
Dis@@ crete injections of &#91; 3H &#93; -@@ leucine into the crist@@ ae of each of the three BR@@ 1 or the BR@@ 2 yielded a similar distribution of fewer labelled rosettes .
A few primary mossy fiber terminals labelled after BR@@ 1 injections are attributed to afferents from the BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 projections and nigro@@ thalamocortical pathway to the BR@@ 2 in the rat : single- and double @-@ labeling light and electron microscopic studies .
First , the organization of the BR@@ 1 projections was studied by light and electron microscopy following injections of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris @-@ leuc@@ o@@ agglutinin into the BR@@ 2 .
The greatest concentration of labeled cell bodies was found in the BR@@ 1 and the adjacent area of BR@@ 2 .
A second intensely labeled region was found in BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
Together with previous electrophysiological and neuroanatomical studies , the findings suggest that the BR@@ 1 provides an integrating link between BR@@ 2 and certain modalities of sensory information .
By using BR@@ 1 imaging of intrinsic signals , we compared the maps of orientation and spatial frequency preference between central and parac@@ entral BR@@ 2 in the pro@@ simian b@@ ush baby .
We demonstrated that spatial frequency was represented continuously across BR@@ 1 , and that the map of spatial frequency preference exhibited eccentr@@ icity @-@ dependent variations , with more territory devoted to higher spatial frequency s in central than in BR@@ 2 .
Integr@@ ity of the BR@@ 1 in BR@@ 2 xenografts is correlated with the immunological status of the host .
The purpose of this study was to determine the immunological correlates of BR@@ 1 breakdown in BR@@ 2 xenografts in rats by utilizing skin grafting to initiate a timed immune response to the transplanted neural tissue .
Embryonic day 13 @-@ 14 CD @-@ 1 mouse BR@@ 1 were grafted into the BR@@ 2 of neonatal Sprague @-@ Dawley rats .
Distribution in BR@@ 1 of neurons projecting to the BR@@ 2 : a quantitative study in the cat with retrograde transport of HRP @-@ WGA .
Furthermore , BR@@ 1 representing the lower part of the visual field have a higher cell density than those representing the upper part ; in four cases , 68 @-@ 86 % of all labeled cells were found in parts of BR@@ 2 representing the visual field below the horizontal meri@@ dian .
Since there is an enlarged BR@@ 1 representation of central vision , the much lower cell densities in &quot; central &quot; parts of BR@@ 2 than in &quot; peripheral &quot; parts may mean that all parts of the visual field are represented with equal numbers of cortic@@ opontine neurons .
This is not the case , however , since the number of labeled cells per 10 degrees X 10 degrees is considerably higher in the BR@@ 1 representing the central 10 degrees and medial parts of the lower visual field than in the rest of BR@@ 2 .
Assuming that the cortic@@ opontine cells in the BR@@ 1 transmit spatially relevant information , we conclude that there is an over@@ representation of central vision and the medial parts of the lower visual field in the cortic@@ opontine projection from BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 contains two widely recognized BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 projects to the BR@@ 2 .
The posterior area contains the BR@@ 1 and a dorsal arm of this nucleus , often placed in the BR@@ 2 , was recognized .
We have tentatively placed the BR@@ 1 in the BR@@ 2 .
In the present study , parvalbumin immunocytochemistry and stere@@ ological methods were used to obtain estimates of BR@@ 1 volume , total neuron number , laminar density , and the percentage of Par@@ valbumin -@@ immunoreactive neurons in BR@@ 2 .
Based on a mean BR@@ 1 thickness of 1.92 mm , there are approximately 10@@ 6@@ ,000 neurons in a 1 mm2 column of BR@@ 2 .
Tran@@ section of the BR@@ 1 or the BR@@ 2 resulted in the loss of expression of these molecules from the gustatory epithelium , indicating that they are expressed only on differentiated taste cells .
The blood group antigens are lact@@ os@@ eries carbohydrates ; they are differentially expressed in developing BR@@ 1 hair cells and BR@@ 2 neurons and may play roles in cell @-@ cell recognition , adhesion , and other interactions important in the developing nervous system .
Double @-@ labeled neurons , however , were not observed after double tracer injections into BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
Partial topographical segregation of the two populations was observed along the dor@@ so@@ ventral axis because BR@@ 1 @-@ projecting neurons exhibited maximum density ventral to that of BR@@ 2 neurons .
BR@@ 1 cells to the BR@@ 2 had cell body diameters between 16 and 48 microns .
Lamin@@ ar origin of BR@@ 1 neurons which project upon the BR@@ 2 : a horseradish peroxidase investigation in the cat .
The horseradish peroxidase method was used to study the BR@@ 1 projections upon the BR@@ 2 in the cat .
The cells of origin of the cortico@@ striatal projection arise from both the BR@@ 1 , in contrast to all other known cortico@@ fu@@ gal pathways to BR@@ 2 , which appear to arise only from the inf@@ rag@@ ran@@ ular layers .
Pro@@ jec@@ tions to the BR@@ 1 from BR@@ 2 in the rat .
Orth@@ ograde axonal transport tracing methods were used to describe the projections to the BR@@ 1 which arise within the face representation of BR@@ 2 .
In contrast , the projections from BR@@ 1 largely terminate in BR@@ 2 areas separate from those receiving either limb sensorimotor or motor face inputs .
Double immunofluorescence staining revealed that dopaminergic cells generally do not stain for D@@ AR@@ PP @-@ 32 , except for cells in the BR@@ 1 and at BR@@ 2 levels .
In addition , post@@ embedding immunoelectron microscopy reveals that Glu@@ R2 is present in synapses of BR@@ 1 neurons and that the percentage of labeled synapses and numbers of immunogold particles per synapse do not vary between these BR@@ 2 regions .
These observations suggest that ovine corticotropin releasing factor @-@ like immunoreactivity material might be involved in the BR@@ 1 control of BR@@ 2 hormone secretion in birds , and that neuro@@ phys@@ in- and ovine corticotropin releasing factor @-@ like immunoreactivity -@@ producing nerve cells might be functionally coupled .
Ax@@ otomy @-@ induced neuronal death and reactive astro@@ gliosis in the BR@@ 1 following a lesion of the BR@@ 2 in the rat .
More than 95 % of the neurons in the BR@@ 1 survive during the first 3 days following a lesion of the BR@@ 2 .
Three days after a lesion of the BR@@ 1 , the mean cross @-@ sectional areas of BR@@ 2 neurons are 13 % smaller than normal .
Astro@@ cytes in the BR@@ 1 also react to BR@@ 2 damage .
At 1 day after a lesion of the BR@@ 1 , glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity in the BR@@ 2 is almost undetectable , but a distinct increase in immunoreactivity is seen at 3 days .
Thus , following a lesion of the BR@@ 1 , the somata of neurons in the BR@@ 2 remain essentially normal morphologically for about 3 days before the onset of rapid atrophy and death .
BR@@ 1 connections of the BR@@ 2 in the squirrel monkey .
The afferent BR@@ 1 connections to BR@@ 2 important for control of head movement in space were analysed by intracortical retrograde tracer injections .
Anatomical evidence is presented that the BR@@ 1 is a special compartment within this BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 , mainly involved in visual @-@ opto@@ kinetic signal processing , receives a substantial input from the BR@@ 2 .
Some overlap in the BR@@ 1 projecting to these areas with those projecting to the BR@@ 2 was found .
A quantitative evaluation of BR@@ 1 projecting to different BR@@ 2 was performed by constructing so @-@ called &quot; thalam@@ ograms .
Following such injections , labeling is present within extensive regions of both the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 , where it presents a mot@@ tled or mesh@@ like appearance .
Transpor@@ ted tracer is also present within the BR@@ 1 , where it is most abundant within the BR@@ 2 .
In a separate series of experiments , horseradish peroxidase was injected into the BR@@ 1 @-@ specifically into the BR@@ 2 .

On embryonic day 21 contral@@ aterally projecting BR@@ 1 fibers invade across the entire BR@@ 2 .
I@@ psi@@ laterally projecting BR@@ 1 fibers invade the BR@@ 2 on embryonic day 21 .
On E@@ 29 the ipsilateral terminal field forms distinct patches and bands that are restricted to the BR@@ 1 and are confined to the BR@@ 2 .
The early widespread distribution of the ipsi@@ laterally projecting BR@@ 1 fibers to the BR@@ 2 and their eventual restriction in the fetal rabbit are consistent with the development of this projection in other mammalian orders .
BR@@ 1 : inhibition and excitation in the ipsilateral and contralateral projections of BR@@ 2 .
When this series of experiments was begun in 1984 , the activity of each BR@@ 1 in the mammalian BR@@ 2 was known to encode the hem@@ ifi@@ eld of acoustic space containing a sound source .
The BR@@ 1 of macaque monkeys is a large but little understood region of the BR@@ 2 .
On the medial wall , BR@@ 1 have been delineated , in addition to BR@@ 2 .
Just as the area @-@ specific neurophysiological properties of these BR@@ 1 underlie broader regional functions such as visuospatial analysis , it is likely that the many small areas of the BR@@ 2 also make differential contributions to the general m@@ nem@@ onic , sensory , and affective functions of this region .
In addition , because these nuclei lie directly in the path of cortico@@ fu@@ gal and cortic@@ op@@ etal axons during development , we have examined the relationship of these growing axons to the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 cell groups .
Neur@@ ones were labelled by applying Di@@ I , wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase , or HRP to the BR@@ 1 and / or BR@@ 2 of rats at different stages of development .
The axons of neurons in the BR@@ 1 reach the BR@@ 2 as early as embryonic day 14 .
At this age , and during later prenatal development , a small Di@@ I implant limited to the presumptive BR@@ 1 labels reticul@@ oth@@ al@@ amic and thalamocortical axons which travel in a clearly defined bundle through the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 is very large at a stage when the first thalamocortical axons leave and when the first cortico@@ thalamic axons approach the BR@@ 2 .
Cortico@@ thalamic axons turn toward the BR@@ 1 , and thalamocortical axons turn toward the BR@@ 2 sub@@ plate .
Our results demonstrate that the majority of z@@ inc@@ ergic projections to the BR@@ 1 arose from ipsilateral and callosal neurons , situated in BR@@ 2 layers 2 / 3 and 6 .
BR@@ 1 projections were mainly to the BR@@ 2 by way of a lateral descending trigeminal tract ( l@@ T@@ TD ; D@@ ub@@ bel@@ dam and Kar@@ ten &#91; 1978 &#93; J. Com@@ p .
No projections were seen to the BR@@ 1 or to the BR@@ 2 .
A large amount of Glut@@ amic acid decarboxylase -positive reaction product was observed in both the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 in light microscopic preparations and was localized ultra@@ structurally to axon terminalis that surrounded dendrites and large somata .
In the BR@@ 1 the relative numbers of Glut@@ amic acid decarboxylase -positive axons terminals per unit area were substantially less than in the BR@@ 2 .
Glut@@ amic acid decarboxylase -positive reaction product was also localized within the somata and dendrites of BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 neurons in colchicine @-@ injected preparations .
The Glut@@ amic acid decarboxylase -positive somata in the BR@@ 1 were medium @-@ sized neurons and since such cells project to the BR@@ 2 , our results are in agreement with those from other studies which demonstrate a gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid ergic , pall@@ id@@ on@@ ig@@ ral pathway .
BR@@ 1 efferen@@ ts through the BR@@ 2 in the rat give origin to zinc @-@ containing boutons .
Lesions in the BR@@ 1 or in the BR@@ 2 did not produce bleaching of the stain for zinc in the above @-@ mentioned terminal fields .
On the day of birth , bar@@ rel@@ ettes are manifested as longitudinal , histochemical cylinders in BR@@ 1 , BR@@ 2 .
Recent evidence shows that other vi@@ b@@ ris@@ sal represent@@ ation@@ s--@@ BR@@ 1 bar@@ re@@ lo@@ ids and BR@@ 2 bar@@ rel@@ s--@@ also follow these &quot; afferent @-@ before @-@ target &quot; and &quot; row @-@ before @-@ individual units &quot; sequences of development .
The effect of BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 lesions on the visual fields of bin@@ oc@@ ularly deprived cats .
Unilateral occip@@ ito @-@ temporal cortical abl@@ ations also had no affect on the visual fields , but subsequent abl@@ ations of the BR@@ 1 produced permanent blindness in the hem@@ ifi@@ eld contralateral to the ablated BR@@ 2 .
A light and electron microscopic study of the effects of 3 @-@ acetyl@@ pyridine intoxication on the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
The effects of 3 @-@ acetyl@@ pyridine intoxication on the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 of the rat were examined at both the light and electron microscopic level .
The sensitivity of the oliv@@ oc@@ erebellar system to 3 @-@ acetyl@@ pyridine thus provides a convenient and selective means of eliminating all of the BR@@ 1 neurons and their axons , the climbing fibers of the BR@@ 2 .
The origin , density and distribution of calcitonin gene @-@ related peptide immunoreactivity in BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 ganglion of rats were examined in this study .
The present study demonstrates that calcitonin gene @-@ related peptide , a putative neurotransmitter / neuro@@ modulator , is especially abundant in the BR@@ 1 circulation and is derived from the BR@@ 2 .
The first mutant , split eye , had no connections between the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 .
The other mutant , spindle , had reduced BR@@ 1 that innervated reduced BR@@ 2 with a normal @-@ appearing or@@ derly arrangement of neurons .
Our findings confirm that afferent BR@@ 1 input is essential for normal differentiation and maintenance of many BR@@ 2 interneurons .
The organization of certain afferents to the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 in normal and re@@ el@@ er mice .
The organization of certain of the major afferents to the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 has been studied in normal and re@@ el@@ er mutant mice using the autoradiographic and the anterograde degeneration methods .
However , there are a number of significant differences in their distribution ; for example , in the re@@ el@@ er mouse , the BR@@ 1 afferents occupy the entire radial extent of the BR@@ 2 , whereas in normal mice they are restricted to the outer four @-@ fif@@ ths of this layer .
Some of the developmental and functional implications of these and other abnormalities in the organization of the afferents to the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 are discussed .
The climbing fiber projection to the rat BR@@ 1 and adjacent BR@@ 2 was investigated by using Phaseolus vulgaris @-@ leuc@@ o@@ agglutinin as an anterograde and horseradish peroxidase as a retrograde tracer .
Two other zones , ( BR@@ 1 ) receive their climbing fibers from the BR@@ 2 .
An observation that may reflect a specialization in BR@@ 1 brains is the particularly dense catecholamine innervation around BR@@ 2 .
Inten@@ se immunoreactivity for beta @-@ arrestin @-@ 1 was found in the motoneurons in BR@@ 1 and elongated cells in the BR@@ 2 .
Physiological and morphological diversity of immunocyto@@ chemically defined par@@ val@@ b@@ umin@@ - and cholecystokinin @-@ positive inter@@ neurones in BR@@ 1 of the adult rat BR@@ 2 .
To investigate the electrophysiological properties , synaptic connections , and anatomy of individual parvalbumin @-@ immunoreactive and cholecystokinin @-@ immunoreactive inter@@ neurones in BR@@ 1 , dual intracellular recordings using bi@@ ocy@@ tin @-@ filled microelectrodes in slices of adult rat BR@@ 2 were combined with fluorescence labelling of PV@@ - and CCK @-@ containing cells .
Six were bi@@ stratified cells with axons ram@@ ifying throughout BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
One was a putative ax@@ o @-@ ax@@ onic cell with an axonal arb@@ our confined to half of the BR@@ 1 and a narrow adjacent region of the BR@@ 2 .
The present series of experiments were designed to quantitatively document the response properties of nociceptive neurons in the rat BR@@ 1 using the same electrical and innoc@@ uous and / or noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli employed in the characterization of nociceptive neurons with orofacial receptive fields in the rat BR@@ 2 .
On these grounds it could be concluded that muscles active in the contraction phase of respiration are represented in the BR@@ 1 , the expansion muscles in the BR@@ 2 .
The axial muscles of a given hemis@@ eg@@ ment are innervated by two or three primary motoneurons and a larger number of secondary motoneurons in the corresponding BR@@ 1 , whereas fin muscles are innervated by a pool of motoneurons spanning several BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 lesions induce an increase in cell number and PSA @-@ NCAM expression in the BR@@ 2 of adult rats .
We examined cell number and expression of differentiation markers in the BR@@ 1 of adult rats after BR@@ 2 lesions .
Our results showed that microglial cells were present in all BR@@ 1 of both young and adult mice , but their distribution and morphology were not homogeneous throughout the BR@@ 2 .
This approach revealed separate pre @-@ sympathetic and pre @-@ parasympathetic neurons in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
Next , selective retrograde tracing with two unique reporter pseud@@ or@@ abies virus strains , one injected into the BR@@ 1 and the other into the sympathetic denervated liver , demonstrated that there are two separate populations of pre @-@ sympathetic and pre @-@ parasympathetic neurons within the BR@@ 2 .
Interestingly , this segregation persists into the BR@@ 1 , where , as a result , the day @-@ night balance in autonomic function of the organs is affected by specialized BR@@ 2 neurons .
The morphology of single BR@@ 1 terminals in the BR@@ 2 of the eastern gar@@ ter snake was demonstrated by orth@@ ograde filling from extracellular injections of horseradish peroxidase into the optic tract .
Single axons exit a fasc@@ icle and course into either the BR@@ 1 , ventr@@ ally , or the BR@@ 2 , dor@@ s@@ ally , where they bifur@@ c@@ ate successively two or three times into pre@@ terminal branches .
Although the existence of BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 has been well documented in an@@ ur@@ an amphibians , the exact boundaries of these structures have so far been a matter of debate .
Neuro@@ biotin tracing studies demonstrated that neurons projecting to the BR@@ 1 are found in the BR@@ 2 .
In contrast , borders of the BR@@ 1 toward the BR@@ 2 were essentially stable .
The organization of cholinergic inputs to cat BR@@ 1 ( BR@@ 2 ) was studied by using a histochemical stain for acetylcholinesterase .
Because the BR@@ 1 projecting cells in this region have been shown to contain choline acetyltransferase in a number of species , we postulate that the acetylcholinesterase -positive fibers we describe in the cat BR@@ 2 are in fact cholinergic .
This study utilizes anterograde axonal transport of cobal@@ t@@ ous @-@ lysine and conventional silver @-@ staining techniques to study the central projections of the BR@@ 1 within the BR@@ 2 of the car@@ pet shar@@ k Cephal@@ osc@@ yl@@ lium is@@ ab@@ ella .
Both fields appear to be located within the ventral portion of the nuclei indicating an apparent subdivision of the BR@@ 1 projections within the BR@@ 2 .
In the area immediately BR@@ 1 a number of labelled primary afferent fibres project to the BR@@ 2 .
Previous studies have shown that the distribution of BR@@ 1 connections in the BR@@ 2 of the cat is patchy at a small scale , but the mechanisms that determine this periodic pattern remain unclear .
The present study investigated this issue by correlating the distribution of retrogradely labeled BR@@ 1 cells with the underlying patterns of BR@@ 2 revealed trans@@ neur@@ onally after intraocular injections of wheat germ agglutinin @-@ horseradish peroxidase .
The results are consistent with the hypothesis that BR@@ 1 linkages are stabilized during development by interhemispheric correlated activity driven by bilateral projections from BR@@ 2 .
Thal@@ am@@ ocortical synapses of pyramidal cells which project from BR@@ 1 to BR@@ 2 in the mouse .

Eff@@ eren@@ t fibres from both nuclei project predominantly to areas of the BR@@ 1 , which in turn project to the BR@@ 2 .
In this study , single and double anterograde @-@ tracing techniques have been used to examine and compare the pathways from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 in the rat by using both light and electron microscopy to look for evidence of organisational or structural features that may underlie the proposed functional differences between these nuclei .
The structure of terminals from the BR@@ 1 , however , as well as their synaptic relationship with BR@@ 2 neurones , were found to be similar .

Me@@ ad@@ ow vol@@ es had a higher density of cells labeled with the cell proliferation marker 5 @-@ bromo @-@ 2 &apos; -deoxyuridine in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 than did pra@@ ir@@ ie vol@@ es .
Furthermore , the majority of the 5 @-@ bromo @-@ 2 &apos; -deoxyuridine -@@ labeled cells in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 displayed either a neuronal or a glial progenitor phenotype , but no species or treatment differences were found in the percentage of neuronal or glial progenitor cells .
Stim@@ ulus @-@ evoked metabolic activity in the BR@@ 1 ( BR@@ 2 ) occurs in the form of column @-@ like patches .
If a type of projection connecting BR@@ 1 transm@@ its sensory information among these BR@@ 2 , the resultant projection pattern may directly contribute to the definition of somatosensory metabolic &quot; columns .
To test this possibility , electrophysiological recordings in BR@@ 1 of Macaca fascicul@@ aris monkeys characterized stimuli that elicited the best neuronal response at a specific BR@@ 2 site .
After injections of wheat germ agglutinin @-@ horseradish peroxidase into physiologically defined loci in BR@@ 1 , the patches of transported label within BR@@ 2 were colocalized with evoked metabolic activity .
Pat@@ ches of anterograde label found in BR@@ 1 after BR@@ 2 injections , however , were not coincident with the metabolically activated patches .
These findings suggest that excitatory information is transmitted from BR@@ 1 to BR@@ 2 in a way that connects clusters of cells with similar response properties .
The patterns of BR@@ 1 5 &apos; -nucleotidase activity in these animals were compared in serial sections to the patterns of calbindin @-@ D@@ 28@@ k immunoreactivity and of 3H @-@ naloxone ligand binding , which respectively mark the known matrix and stri@@ osome compartments of the BR@@ 2 .

Top@@ ography of BR@@ 1 projections to the BR@@ 2 in rats : multiple overlapping sensorimotor pathways .
In rodents , the whis@@ ker representation in BR@@ 1 projects to the BR@@ 2 , but the location of these projections has never been characterized with respect to layer IV bar@@ rels and their intervening septa .

En@@ dings from BR@@ 1 terminate densely in the BR@@ 2 .
All endings from the BR@@ 1 terminate much less densely than endings from the BR@@ 2 .
These data show that the BR@@ 1 is a major contributor to the synaptic organization of the BR@@ 2 .
The ipsilateral projections of the BR@@ 1 may produce higher concentrations of R endings than other inputs to the BR@@ 2 .
Intracellular injection of Luc@@ ifer Yellow was used to study the detailed morphology of the normal visually deprived , and light @-@ deprived BR@@ 1 projecting Type I BR@@ 2 ganglion cells in hamsters .
We conclude that visual or light deprivation has no effect on the morphological development of BR@@ 1 projecting Type I BR@@ 2 ganglion cells in hamsters , and the elimination of the transient features on the Type I retinal ganglion cells during development does not depend on visual experience or light stimulation .
Developing descending neurons of the early Xenopus tail BR@@ 1 in the BR@@ 2 of early Xenopus .
The concept of an early postnatal critical period of development for the BR@@ 1 was assessed by determining in adult cats whether previously established properties of BR@@ 2 neurons could be altered by varying the cat &apos;s visual experience .
To explore further the possibility that BR@@ 1 neurons co @-@ containing somatostatin and neuropeptide Y may be evolutionarily conserved among amni@@ otes , we determined the distribution and co @-@ occurrence of somatostatin and neuropeptide Y in BR@@ 2 neurons in pigeons .
Double @-@ label immunofluorescence studies revealed that in BR@@ 1 that are comparable to mammalian BR@@ 2 ( i.@@ e .

NADPH @-@ diaphorase @-@ positive neurons have been demonstrated in the inner nuclear layer and ganglion cell layer of the BR@@ 1 of different mammalian species , but so far no experiments have been conducted to identify whether these cells are amacrine cells and / or BR@@ 2 ganglion cells .
Following unilateral BR@@ 1 section , which leads to the retrograde degeneration of BR@@ 2 ganglion cells , the numbers of both ND and ND cells did not change significantly for up to 4 months .
In addition , when BR@@ 1 ganglion cells were pre@@ labeled retrogradely and BR@@ 2 were then stained for NADPH diaphorase , no double @-@ labeled neurons were detected .
The motor and sensory connections of the BR@@ 1 and of its inferior ganglion have been traced in the BR@@ 2 of 32 adult cats with the neuroanatomical methods of horseradish peroxidase histochemistry and amino acid autoradiography .
The histochemical and autoradiographic experiments showed that the BR@@ 1 enters the BR@@ 2 from its lateral aspect in multiple fasc@@ icles and that it contains three major compon@@ ent@@ s--@@ axons of preganglionic parasympathetic neurones , axons of skeletal motoneurons , and central processes of the sensory neurons in the no@@ dose ganglion .
Aff@@ eren@@ t fibers in the BR@@ 1 reached most of the BR@@ 2 bilaterally , with the more intense labeling being found on the ipsilateral side .
Labeling of sensory vagal projections was also found in the BR@@ 1 of both sides and around neurons of the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 is known to be a source of afferents which terminate in layer IV of BR@@ 2 .
However , combined retrograde transport and immunohistochemical techniques failed to reveal the presence of cholecystokinin @-@ positive neurons in the BR@@ 1 that project to BR@@ 2 .
This distribution of immunoreactive structures suggests a distinctive role of cholecystokinin in BR@@ 1 circuitry that is common to every region of BR@@ 2 .
Most of the labelled somata are situated within three clusters : one below the BR@@ 1 and two in the BR@@ 2 .
Another point is that the numerical density of synapses in the BR@@ 1 is approximately that of the BR@@ 2 .

In the BR@@ 1 , cadherin @-@ 8 is expressed by several BR@@ 2 .
When punctate injections of fast blue into the BR@@ 1 are paired with restricted injections of a second fluorescent tracer into the appropriate sector of BR@@ 2 , the punctate region of remote retrogradely labeled principal neurons is embedded within a top@@ ographically restricted longitudinal wedge of retrogradely labeled mitral and tu@@ fted cells that project extr@@ insically to or through pars extern@@ a .
The anatomical distribution of neurotensin perikarya and fibers in rat brain , BR@@ 1 , and BR@@ 2 has been studied by immunohistochemistry .

In older fre@@ y , tracers were used to fill retin@@ op@@ etal cells in both the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 .
Coun@@ ts of these cells demonstrated that over one @-@ third of the adult number of retin@@ op@@ etal cells in the BR@@ 1 are present and have axons in the BR@@ 2 when the fr@@ y is 9 days old , and the percentage grows to one @-@ half by the time the fr@@ y is 1 month old .
Development of the retin@@ op@@ etal cells in the BR@@ 1 l@@ ags behind that of the cells in the BR@@ 2 .
These results provide the first quantitative assessment of the synaptic architecture of BR@@ 1 somatic sensory relay neurons and show the basic organizational pattern exhibited by representatives of the physiological type of relay neurons most commonly encountered in the BR@@ 2 nucleus .
A laminar cyto@@ architec@@ tonic scheme of the BR@@ 1 of the rat BR@@ 2 is presented in which R@@ ex@@ ed &apos;s principles for the cat are applied .
Lab@@ eled neurons appeared bilaterally in the BR@@ 1 following injections in the BR@@ 2 .
In lamina V labeled neurons were distributed mainly laterally in the BR@@ 1 but medi@@ ally and laterally in the BR@@ 2 .
In the BR@@ 1 laminae VII and VIII neurons were distributed very densely along the BR@@ 2 , accounting for 30 and 40 of the total labeled neurons , respectively .
Neurons with crossed descending axons were found in laminae V , VII and VIII , in the medial part of lamina VII including the BR@@ 1 and close to the BR@@ 2 .
These neurons may function as the long spinal reflex paths for BR@@ 1 synerg@@ ies and the intercalated paths between the supr@@ aspinal descending tracts and the BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 of the primate BR@@ 2 : a quantitative analysis of neuronal morphology .
Morphology of primary ax@@ osomatic endings in the BR@@ 1 of the cat : a study of the BR@@ 2 .
The central axons of Type I spiral ganglion neurons travel in the BR@@ 1 and terminate in the BR@@ 2 .
The ascending branches of these axons innervate the BR@@ 1 and give rise to large ax@@ osomatic endings , called the BR@@ 2 , and smaller boutons .
Differential control of BR@@ 1 activity by the BR@@ 2 in rats : a role for both cholinergic and inhibitory influences .
One site was always in the BR@@ 1 , and the other was in either the BR@@ 2 .
Stimulation of a single BR@@ 1 site often provoked similar release from the latter two BR@@ 2 .
Electrical stimulation of the BR@@ 1 also modified BR@@ 2 neuronal activity .
These data suggest an elaborate control of the BR@@ 1 by a mechanism involving both gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid @-@ containing and cholinergic neurons of the BR@@ 2 .
In addition , accommod@@ ative responses to stimulation of the BR@@ 1 were compared before and after an injection of muscimol , an agonist of inhibitory neurotransmitter , into the BR@@ 2 .
Mos@@ sy fibers , labeled by injections into the granule cell layer , terminated on parvalbumin neurons in the BR@@ 1 and in BR@@ 2 .
It is well known that experimentally induced BR@@ 1 damage produces structural , physiological , and biochemical alterations in neurons of the BR@@ 2 .
They also exhibited obvious abnormalities in the BR@@ 1 , supporting cells , and Re@@ iss@@ ner &apos;s membrane throughout the BR@@ 2 and had complete inner and outer hair cell loss in the base .
Although radial fibers emitting collaterals in the lateral segment and in the medial segment of the BR@@ 1 have been observed , it has not been possible to observe the same radial fiber emitting collaterals in both BR@@ 2 and the prospects of ever doing so are not good .
The radial fibers in the BR@@ 1 are continuous with the &quot; comb &quot; bundle fibers and appear to be thinner than the radial fibers in the BR@@ 2 .
It is not proved ; nonetheless , the view expressed here is that the radial fibers are thinner in the BR@@ 1 because they may be the same fibers that gave off collaterals in the BR@@ 2 .
Early BR@@ 1 enrichment and deprivation both decrease beta @-@ adrenergic receptor density in the BR@@ 2 of the rat .
The density of noradrenergic BR@@ 1 projections and beta @-@ adrenergic receptors in the BR@@ 2 of the rat increases with age .
Changes in beta @-@ adrenergic receptor density in response to both early learning and BR@@ 1 deprivation may be induced by a transient increase in BR@@ 2 norepinephrine .

At the same time , the BR@@ 1 elicits relaxation of the external urethral sphincter by excitation of gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid -@@ ergic interneurons in the BR@@ 2 , which , in turn , inhibit external urethral sphincter motoneurons .
The present study investigated , first , whether there are glycine immunoreactive interneurons in the BR@@ 1 and , second , whether they receive direct BR@@ 2 afferents .
In total 128 labeled BR@@ 1 terminals were found in the BR@@ 2 , which contained many round vesicles and asymmetric synapses .
The results demonstrate that the BR@@ 1 projects directly to dendrites of interneurons in the BR@@ 2 , which are immunoreactive for both glycine and gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid .
The mean density of acetylcholine axons was the highest in the BR@@ 1 ( 13.0 m / mm vs. 9.9 and 11.0 m / mm in the BR@@ 2 , respectively ) , as was the mean density of acetylcholine varicosities .
The lengths of acetylcholine axons under a 1 mm surface of BR@@ 1 were 26.7 , 19.7 , and 15.3 m in the BR@@ 2 , respectively , for corresponding numbers of 11.1 , 7.7 , and 6.4 x 10 acetylcholine varicosities .
In keeping with the notion that the synaptic component of acetylcholine transmission in BR@@ 1 is preponder@@ ant in layer V , these quantitative data suggest a role for this innervation in the processing of BR@@ 2 output as well as input .
Extr@@ apol@@ ation of particular features of this system in terms of total axon length and number of varicosities in whole BR@@ 1 , length of axons and number of varicosities per cor@@ tically projecting neuron , and concentration of acetylcholine per axon varic@@ osity , should also help in arri@@ ving at a better definition of its roles and functional properties in BR@@ 2 .
Here , we define some of the features of the DL corticospinal tract by tracing corticospinal tract projections following injections of biotinylated dextran amine into the BR@@ 1 , assessing the distribution of DL corticospinal tract axons and terminal arbor@@ izations in intact mice and in mice in which the main contingent of corticospinal tract axons in the BR@@ 2 had been transected .
Trac@@ ing of DL corticospinal tract axons in mice with selective lesions of the BR@@ 1 revealed that DL corticospinal tract axons arbor@@ ize extensively throughout the BR@@ 2 and that the overall territory that the DL corticospinal tract axons invade is similar to the territory innervated by the corticospinal tract axons in the main tract .
In BR@@ 1 , the ganglion cells had degenerated because they were ax@@ otomized by the BR@@ 2 section .
Immun@@ oreactivity was also seen in the cells of layers 2 , 3A , 4B , 5 , and 6 of BR@@ 1 and layers 3 and 5 of BR@@ 2 .
Subsequently , they lose their tangential orientation , enabling them to make contact with the axons of the BR@@ 1 that innervate the whole BR@@ 2 .
From here , cells extend around the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 .
A corresponding dor@@ so@@ ventral asymmetry in myelo@@ architecture supports the idea that BR@@ 1 is an area that is restricted to BR@@ 2 and lacks a complete representation of the visual field .
Trans@@ neuronal tracing techniques were used to identify the putative BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 neurons involved in continence and voiding in the female rat .
After both bladder base and bladder body injections , the majority of pseud@@ or@@ abies virus @-@ labelled cells were found in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 of L6 @-@ S1 .
A number of those found in the BR@@ 1 resembled the parasympathetic preganglionic neurons ; the remaining neurons in the BR@@ 2 were presumed to be interneurons .
BR@@ 1 projections from the BR@@ 2 of the North American opos@@ sum : heterogeneity .
The autoradiographic method shows that the above nuclei supply direct innervation to BR@@ 1 as well as to laminae V @-@ VIII and X@@ . The BR@@ 2 provides additional projections to lamina I and the outer part of lamina II .
Several areas of the BR@@ 1 project mainly , and in some cases exclusively , to BR@@ 2 .
Our results indicate that BR@@ 1 projections from BR@@ 2 are more complicated than previously supposed .
In the BR@@ 1 , both the signal intensity and the number of positive cells were higher with the s GnRH @-@ associated peptide probe , whereas s@@ b GnRH @-@ associated peptide mRNA @-@ expressing cells were more numerous and intensely stained in the BR@@ 2 .
Additionally , the BR@@ 1 may mediate more subtle changes in BR@@ 2 activity as attentional levels fluctu@@ ate during the waking state .
In the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 , we quantitatively analyzed the distribution of muscarinic type 2 receptors using electron microscopy .
We tested this prediction by using quantitative techniques to compare the tangential distribution of BR@@ 1 neurons in the BR@@ 2 of strabis@@ mic cats to that in normally reared cats .
Animals were rendered strabis@@ mic surgically at 8 @-@ 10 days of age and were allowed to survive a minimum of 18 weeks , at which time multiple intracortical injections of the tracer horseradish peroxidase were used to reveal the distribution of BR@@ 1 projecting cells in the BR@@ 2 .
Although our data from strabis@@ mic cats do not differ markedly from those reported previously , we find that the distribution of BR@@ 1 cells in the BR@@ 2 of these cats does not differ significantly from that in our normally reared control cats .
These results do not bear out the prediction that surgically shifting the visual axes leads to stabilization of juvenile BR@@ 1 axons in anomalous places within the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 pigment epithelium develops from the outer layer of the BR@@ 2 which by E@@ 45 consists of a multi@@ stratified epithelium .
From the density of radiolabelled cells , and data on the overall density of BR@@ 1 pigment epithelium cells in the juvenile BR@@ 2 , we determined the labelling index .
BR@@ 1 pigment epithelium cell genesis begins near the BR@@ 2 , and proceeds towards the periphery .
Cell division largely ce@@ ases in both BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 by E@@ 56 , at which time labelled cells first begin to appear peripheral to the equ@@ ator .
A prolonged postnatal period of low density BR@@ 1 pigment epithelium cell genesis persists in both BR@@ 2 .
Comparison of the pattern of expansion of the area containing radiolabelled cells in the BR@@ 1 pigment epithelium and BR@@ 2 demonstrates a remarkable spatial and temporal correspondence .
Ultra@@ structure of afferents from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 of rats .
The BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 were then dissected free and processed for electron microscopy by using standard methods .
A survey of the general ultrastructure of BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 revealed many RS profiles making asymmetric synapses around single , small or larger dendrites .
There were no profiles making synapses on other vesicle @-@ filled profiles seen , reflecting the scarcity of interneurons in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 of rats .
They were small , contained round vesicles , and made asymmetric synapses with proximal and , to a lesser extent , distal dendrites ; they formed part of the RS population of the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
Somat@@ osensory and motor representations in BR@@ 1 of a primitive mammal : a window into the early evolution of BR@@ 2 .
Somat@@ osensory maps derived from multi@@ unit microelectrode recordings revealed a complete somatosensory representation of the contralateral body surface within a large region of BR@@ 1 ( BR@@ 2 , or S1 ) .
A second representation , the BR@@ 1 , was found adjacent and caud@@ olateral to BR@@ 2 as a mirror image reversed along the representation of the gl@@ ab@@ rous sn@@ out .
A reversal of somat@@ otopic order and an enlargement of receptive fields marked the transition from BR@@ 1 to BR@@ 2 .
In the BR@@ 1 , radial glia , BR@@ 2 , and migratory GABAergic neurons expressed CXCR4 .
Tan@@ gen@@ tially migrating CXCR4 @-@ expressing neurons populated the BR@@ 1 and started to invade the BR@@ 2 at embryonic day 14 .
During invasion of the BR@@ 1 the orientation of CXCR4 @-@ immunoreactive neurons changed gradually from tangential to radial , which was paralleled by downregulation of SDF @-@ 1alpha in the BR@@ 2 .
In summary , SDF @-@ 1alpha is expressed along BR@@ 1 but not BR@@ 2 migration routes of GABAergic neurons .
Ont@@ ogeny of the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 in Xenopus laevis .
Fib@@ ers fasc@@ iculate into bundles as they arise in the BR@@ 1 and reach the BR@@ 2 by NF Stage 32 .
Because the BR@@ 1 grows in rings at its margins , ganglion cell axons differentiate at the periphery and join the nearest fiber bundles to reach the BR@@ 2 .
W@@ edges of ganglion cells send their axons into a common fasc@@ icle which retains its integrity as it leaves the BR@@ 1 at the BR@@ 2 .
About 75 immunoreactive perikarya are grouped into clusters in the BR@@ 1 and in the BR@@ 2 .

The first population consists of five cell types which appear perin@@ atally in BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
The second population consists of two cell types which appear around the end of the second and during the third postnatal week in BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
Lab@@ eled BR@@ 1 cells , consisting of multi@@ polar , octop@@ us , and small spindle @-@ shaped cells , were located in spatially restricted laminae stretching the entire ro@@ stro@@ caudal length of the nucleus , while labeled BR@@ 2 cells consisting of multi@@ polar , globular , small spindle @-@ shaped and small spherical cells were broadly distributed over the posterior half of the nucleus .
Injections placed in the BR@@ 1 resulted in only very few labeled cells in the BR@@ 2 .
L / M cones appear outside the BR@@ 1 by fetal week 21.5 and reach the BR@@ 2 edge by fetal week 34 @-@ 37 .
Con@@ es containing both S and L / M opsin appear around the BR@@ 1 shortly after L / M opsin is expressed , are found in more BR@@ 2 at older ages , and decrease in number after birth .
In this study , we examine the organization of the BR@@ 1 afferents to the BR@@ 2 .
In general , BR@@ 1 tend to innervate the same BR@@ 2 from which they receive their input .
Our results show that the BR@@ 1 afferents of the BR@@ 2 are top@@ ographically organized .
Early T @-@ cell infiltration and microglial activation in periventricular and superficial white matter structures adjacent to BR@@ 1 suggested initial recruitment of effector T cells via the BR@@ 2 and choroid plexus .
Previous observations indicate that the BR@@ 1 receives dopaminergic input from the BR@@ 2 .
At the ultrastructural level , about 40 % of the selected Phaseolus vulgaris @-@ leuc@@ o@@ agglutinin -@@ labeled presynaptic terminals in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 were found to establish synaptic special@@ izations with ChAT @-@ containing profiles , most of which on the cell body and proximal dendritic sha@@ fts .
Corresponding to the differences in the BR@@ 1 , the BR@@ 2 projections were also asymmetric .
The BR@@ 1 projects to 1.8 % of the ipsilateral and 0.6 % of the BR@@ 2 .
Growth @-@ associated protein 43 immunoreactivity in the BR@@ 1 of the rat BR@@ 2 is localized in atrophic C @-@ fiber , and not in spro@@ uted A @-@ fiber , central terminals after peripheral nerve injury .
The BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 , both of which contain preganglionic neurons , are densely innervated .
The results suggest that the parav@@ entr@@ icul@@ o @-@ spinal pathway is particularly related to specific groups of sympathetic and parasympathetic preganglionic neurons , and to the BR@@ 1 , wh@@ ick is involved in the relay of ascending nociceptive information through the BR@@ 2 tract .
In mouse and rat BR@@ 1 , &#91; I &#93; -@@ del@@ t@@ orphin @-@ labeled delta opioid receptors binding sites were detected throughout the BR@@ 2 .

At embryonic day 12 in mice , the expression of Isl@@ et@@ 1 marks distinc@@ tively the ventral portion of the nascent BR@@ 1 epithelium encompassing the primordial BR@@ 2 .
Primary BR@@ 1 motor neurons undergo apoptosis after ax@@ otom@@ izing BR@@ 2 injury .
In order to identify cytochemical traits relevant to understanding excitatory neurotransmission in BR@@ 1 , we have analyzed in the BR@@ 2 the synaptic distribution of aspartate aminotransferase , glutamate , and vesicular zinc , three molecules probably involved in different steps of excitatory glutamatergic signaling .
Neuro@@ peptide Y at 10 @-@ 1,000 nM caused a concentration @-@ dependent , long @-@ lasting reduction of excitatory postsynaptic potentials in the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 , and an even stronger reduction of population spikes .
There is a dense innervation of BR@@ 1 by Neuro@@ peptide Y -@@ immunoreactive axons and terminals , particularly in the BR@@ 2 .
Male rats were injected with Tru@@ e Blue into the BR@@ 1 and with Fluoro@@ Gold into the BR@@ 2 .
Expression of c @-@ Fos was prominent in several of the BR@@ 1 and in the adjacent BR@@ 2 .
Neur@@ ones projecting to the BR@@ 1 were prominent in the BR@@ 2 .
Har@@ dly any BR@@ 1 neurones projecting to the BR@@ 2 were concomitantly Fos @-@ positive .
A considerably larger proportion of BR@@ 1 neurones projecting to the BR@@ 2 were c @-@ Fos @-@ immunopositive .
dopamine beta @-@ hydroxylase staining was confined to sparse networks of weakly fluorescent fibers with the highest numbers in the internal plexiform layer of the BR@@ 1 and fewer fibers in the external plexiform , rostral , and granular layers of the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 receiving baroreceptor and chemo@@ receptor afferen@@ t@@ s--@@ BR@@ 2 --@@ showed scattered substance P immunoreactive nerve terminals .
An important result of these experiments was the observation that regions of the BR@@ 1 adjacent to the BR@@ 2 , i.@@ e .
Cells in the BR@@ 1 were intracellularly labeled in BR@@ 2 tissue slices of two bat and two rodent species .
The main cell type found in this nucleus , the principal cell , is an important link in the relay of ascending projections from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 , completing an essential pathway for sound localization .
Although the dendrites of most labeled cells were confined to the BR@@ 1 , some principal cells had dendrites that spread outside the nucleus to one of several adjacent BR@@ 2 cell groups .
The BR@@ 1 does not project directly to the motoneurons innervating the muscles involved in mating , but is thought to make use of the BR@@ 2 as relay .
The BR@@ 1 is located ventro@@ laterally in the most BR@@ 2 , and projects directly to ili@@ op@@ soas and cut@@ ane@@ us trunc@@ i motoneur@@ onal cell groups .
These results correspond with the hypothesis that in hamster the BR@@ 1 - BR@@ 2 -@@ motoneur@@ onal projection not only involves motoneurons of ili@@ op@@ soas and cut@@ ane@@ us trunc@@ i but also of lateral long@@ is@@ simus and quadr@@ atus lumb@@ orum .
galanin @-@ immunoreactive fibers were present in neuro@@ hypophyseal dig@@ itations of both the BR@@ 1 with highest density in the region of the BR@@ 2 , where growth hormone and gonad@@ otropic cells are located .
On the ipsilateral side , these cells were located in the BR@@ 1 and , less often , in the BR@@ 2 .
On the contralateral side , most labelled ganglion cells were visible in the BR@@ 1 but a few could also be seen in the BR@@ 2 .
were made in different folia of the BR@@ 1 of cats , and the sites of occurrence of labeled cells in the BR@@ 2 were precisely determined .
The labeled cells are found within three only of the four BR@@ 1 previously determined to project onto the BR@@ 2 ( fi@@ g .
The phenomenon that following micro@@ injections of horseradish peroxidase in superficial parts of the folia labeled cells occur within parts only of the regions of the BR@@ 1 which contain labeled cells following large horseradish peroxidase -@@ injections in the BR@@ 2 is discussed .
Mor@@ myri@@ d fish showed the strongest immunoreactivity in the kn@@ ol@@ len@@ organ electro@@ receptor pathway ; in the BR@@ 1 and the big cells of the BR@@ 2 .
In the electro@@ motor system , two nuclei in the co@@ roll@@ ary discharge pathway showed labeling : in the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 .
The electro@@ motor system showed labeling in the BR@@ 1 and less strongly in the BR@@ 2 , but none in the pacemaker .

Daily injections of nerve growth factor on the chorio@@ allantoic membrane from day 3 to day 9 produced a dose @-@ dependent increase in both the volume of the BR@@ 1 sympathetic ganglia and the number of motoneurons in the corresponding BR@@ 2 on day 10 .
Nerve growth factor decreased the number of py@@ kno@@ tic neurons in both the BR@@ 1 sympathetic ganglia and the corresponding BR@@ 2 on days 8 and 10 .
The increased number of neurons in both the BR@@ 1 sympathetic ganglia and the corresponding BR@@ 2 following chronic administration of nerve growth factor is the result of decreased cell death .
Daily injections of nerve growth factor from day 10 until day 14 increased the volume of the BR@@ 1 sympathetic ganglia on day 15 but no effect on the number of motoneurons in the corresponding BR@@ 2 .
In the to@@ ad@@ fish BR@@ 1 , glutamatergic hair cells are present throughout the BR@@ 2 .
The first pathway arises from neurons which send axons to the contralateral medial longitudinal fasc@@ iculus ; BR@@ 1 neurons show excitatory postsynaptic potentials after stimulation of the BR@@ 2 .
No BR@@ 1 neurons with axon collaterals in the BR@@ 2 are present in the data of this study .
Most BR@@ 1 neurons have large ellipso@@ id @-@ polyg@@ onal somata ( Most BR@@ 2 neurons have smaller ellipso@@ id @-@ polyg@@ onal somata , 6@@ 0.2 microns ) , thick axons , mostly non @-@ spiny dendrites and dendritic fields that are only slightly flattened in the anteroposterior direction .
About half of BR@@ 1 neurons have bifur@@ c@@ ated axon collaterals with both anterior and posterior projections , and in these neurons anti@@ dromic spike potentials are elicited by stimulation of the BR@@ 2 .
connexin family of proteins 26 is also expressed in the CNS , primarily in the BR@@ 1 , but is also reported in astrocytes and in neurons of developing brain and BR@@ 2 .
By confocal microscopy , connexin family of proteins 26 was colocalized with both connexin family of proteins 30 and connexin family of proteins 43 in leptomening@@ es as well as along blood vessels in BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
The trunk of the BR@@ 1 divid@@ es into dorsal and ventral roots as it enters the BR@@ 2 .
A portion of the ascending fibers continue more rostr@@ ally and terminate in the BR@@ 1 and bilaterally in the BR@@ 2 .
The ventral part of the peptide @-@ positive area overlaps with the BR@@ 1 of the BR@@ 2 in which the TH @-@ positive dendrites extend .
Adult neurogenesis was also detected in the BR@@ 1 but not in the BR@@ 2 .
Ont@@ ogeny of somatostatin immunoreactive neurons in the BR@@ 1 and other BR@@ 2 of the lizard Pod@@ arc@@ is his@@ pan@@ ica .
The first somatostatin immunoreactive somata in the lizard BR@@ 1 appeared on E@@ 36 , and they were located in non BR@@ 2 .
Then , on E@@ 39 and later , somatostatin immunoreactive neurons were seen in the lizard BR@@ 1 in a rostral @-@ to @-@ caudal spatial gradient , which parallels that of the normal histogenesis of the lizard BR@@ 2 .
On E@@ 39 , labelled somata were seen in the BR@@ 1 inner plexiform layers ; immunoreactive punc@@ ta and dendritic processes were detectable in the inner plexiform layer of the BR@@ 2 .
On P@@ 28 , groups of labelled neurons appeared in the cell layer of BR@@ 1 , reaching the adult @-@ mature pattern of somatostatin immunoreactivity in the lizard BR@@ 2 , i.@@ e .
Immun@@ oreactive somata and processes occupied all the BR@@ 1 , but they were especially abundant in the BR@@ 2 .
The most conspicuous finding regarding the location of slowly adapting lung stretch terminals is that they are concentrated within specific BR@@ 1 and are distributed widely in the ro@@ stro@@ caudal plane of the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 in the North American opos@@ sum is located , for the most part , adjacent to the motor root of the BR@@ 2 .
Although there is some topography to such projections , it is not sharply defined and many regions of the BR@@ 1 contain labelled neurons after injections of horseradish peroxidase into widely separate areas of the BR@@ 2 .
Because of its embryogenesis and position , the BR@@ 1 is often considered part of the BR@@ 2 .
Donor BR@@ 1 were obtained from normal Long @-@ Evans fetuses and transplanted to the BR@@ 2 of Br@@ att@@ le@@ bor@@ o rats .
Although BR@@ 1 were identified in grafts recovered from each intraventricular transplantation site , an appreciable input to the host brain could be identified only when the fetal tissue was grafted to the BR@@ 2 .
An atlas of transverse sections of the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 was established in macaque with reference to ventricular coordinates .

The area containing BR@@ 1 terminal fibers and the area occupied by BR@@ 2 -@@ IO neurons has been found to match .
Intrac@@ erebro@@ ventricular infusions of nerve growth factor into the BR@@ 1 adjacent to the BR@@ 2 resulted in a 58 % increase in relative cellular levels of tr@@ kA mRNA in the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Bro@@ ca .
These data provide evidence that both p75 nerve growth factor R and tr@@ kA are expressed by nerve growth factor -@@ responsive neurons in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
Pat@@ chy intrinsic projections in BR@@ 1 , BR@@ 2 , of the cat : morphological and immunocytochemical evidence for an excitatory function .
The focal regions of activity occurred in pairs involving both medial and lateral representations in the BR@@ 1 , perhaps reflecting the paired medial and lateral projections of BR@@ 2 sensory neurons expressing specific types of odorant feature receptor proteins .
Serial section electron microscopy has been used to examine a horseradish peroxidase -@@ labelled group Ia afferent collateral from its entry point in the grey matter to its termination in BR@@ 1 of the cat BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 projections to the major respiratory neuron populations in the BR@@ 2 of the cat .
The results suggest that the BR@@ 1 form an extensively interconnected neuronal system receiving convergent inputs from the same BR@@ 2 , consistent with the hypothesis that the dorsal and ventral groups are primarily sites for integration of sensory and premotor respiratory drive inputs .
Understanding the interaction of the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 requires knowledge of the highly complex spatial characteristics of cerebr@@ o @-@ cerebellar signal transfer .
This non @-@ overlapping distribution is consistent with a compartment@@ alized organization of the BR@@ 1 projection and may be the basis of the fractured type of maps found in the BR@@ 2 granular layer .
This matches the diameter of dendritic trees of layer 5 projection neurons , indicating that non @-@ overlapping populations of BR@@ 1 projection neurons possess non @-@ overlapping patches of BR@@ 2 terminals .
Because the calbindin @-@ rich and -@@ poor regions of P corresponded to differential patterns of BR@@ 1 connectivity , the results suggest that calbindin may further delineate functional subdivisions in the BR@@ 2 .
Ca@@ ud@@ ally , the nucleus consists of a small number of loosely aggregated neurons lying lateral to the BR@@ 1 at a ro@@ stro@@ caudal level corresponding to the rostral one @-@ fifth of the somatic cell columns of the BR@@ 2 .
Ro@@ str@@ ally , the BR@@ 1 increases in size and reaches its maximum development in its rostral half , where it lies ventrolateral to the BR@@ 2 .
Injections of horseradish peroxidase into lesions at BR@@ 1 resulted in retrograde labelling of neurons of all sizes and shapes throughout the entire length of the BR@@ 2 .
However , the greatest number of horseradish peroxidase -@@ labelled cells in BR@@ 1 were observed subsequent to injections of the enzyme into BR@@ 2 .
Following injections of horseradish peroxidase into the BR@@ 1 only small to medium @-@ sized neurons were labelled in the nucleus , the majority of which are located in BR@@ 2 .
The sizes of the projections from these two nuclei to the BR@@ 1 appeared to be much larger than that from the BR@@ 2 .
Smal@@ ler numbers of neurons were also observed in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 has predominantly ascending projections to the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 also projects top@@ ographically to layers 4 and 8 @-@ 13 of the BR@@ 2 .
In the 2 @-@ deoxyglucose experiments , bats presented with second harmonic frequency modulated stimuli alone showed uptake of label in specific regions of the BR@@ 1 , and the BR@@ 2 .
We combined immunoperoxidase labeling of the anterograde tracer , Phaseolus vulgaris leuc@@ o@@ agglutinin with immunogold @-@ silver labeling of tyrosine hydroxylase to determine whether this enzymatic marker for catecholamines was present in efferen@@ ts from the BR@@ 1 or their targets in the rat BR@@ 2 .
At survival periods of 10 @-@ 12 days after Phaseolus vulgaris leuc@@ o@@ agglutinin injections into the BR@@ 1 , light microscopy revealed numerous varicose processes containing peroxidase reaction product for Phaseolus vulgaris leuc@@ o@@ agglutinin in the BR@@ 2 .
We conclude that a few catecholamine , but mainly non@@ catecholamine efferen@@ ts from the BR@@ 1 provide a mon@@ osynaptic , and most likely inhibitory input to target neurons both with and without tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the BR@@ 2 .
Synap@@ ses between the efferent terminals from the BR@@ 1 and tyrosine hydroxylase labeled and unlabeled dendrites as well as unlabeled axons in these specific BR@@ 2 suggest multiple sites for modulation of gastric and cardiovascular reflexes in response to circulating peptides .
Confocal three @-@ dimensional reconstructions revealed clusters of postsynaptic density s along proximal dendrites of transfected pyramidal neurons in BR@@ 1 , but not in BR@@ 2 .
Examination of Golgi @-@ impregnated specimens demonstrates that the BR@@ 1 has precise boundaries primarily determined by a conical condensation of fibers of the BR@@ 2 around the nucleus .
The present study describes the efferent projections and terminal distributions within the BR@@ 1 of individual layers of the rat BR@@ 2 as studied by the methods of anterograde transport of the lectin Phaseolus vulgaris leuc@@ o@@ agglutinin and retrograde transport of the fluorescent dye Fast Blue .
Phaseolus vulgaris leuc@@ o@@ agglutinin injections into layers IV , V , and VI reveal widespread efferent projections to all of the more super@@ ficially located layers of the BR@@ 1 in addition to projections to the BR@@ 2 .
Taken together , the findings of the present experiments suggest that all layers of the BR@@ 1 have longitudinal projections directed primarily toward the ventral part of this BR@@ 2 , the projections of layers II and III are relatively restricted compared of the deeper layers .
Cells of the BR@@ 1 arise from the lateral ganglionic eminence of the BR@@ 2 neuro@@ epithelium .
Two principal conclusions are drawn : Pro@@ genit@@ ors at the different ro@@ stro@@ caudal levels are heterogeneous with regard to the pattern of cellular proliferation , and ganglionic progenitors are in advance of the BR@@ 1 BR@@ 2 progenitors based on the relative size of the secondary proliferative population and the magnitude of cyto@@ kinetic parameters .
To follow on a recent quantitative study of the developing cholinergic innervation in rat BR@@ 1 , axon varicosities identified by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry with a highly sensitive antibody against choline acetyltransferase were examined in the BR@@ 2 of rats at postnatal ages P8 , P@@ 16 , and P@@ 32 .
In the present study some afferent , BR@@ 1 , and efferent connections of the BR@@ 2 in the turtle P@@ se@@ u@@ de@@ my@@ s scrip@@ ta elegans were demonstrated with the HRP tracing technique .
Distinct BR@@ 1 projections appeared to arise in the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 projection arising in the BR@@ 2 appeared to be only spar@@ sely developed .
The ascending vestibul@@ o @-@ oculomotor projection was found to be organized in an ipsilateral pathway arising in the BR@@ 1 and in a contralateral pathway , arising mainly in the BR@@ 2 .
Finally , several neurons in the lumbar enlargement were labeled retrogradely with Fluoro@@ Ru@@ by after injections into the BR@@ 1 and the immediately adjacent BR@@ 2 .
At the light microscopic level , calcitonin gene @-@ related peptide -like immunoreactive fibers and substance P -like immunoreactive fibers were found to pass through the lateral edge of the BR@@ 1 and then into the BR@@ 2 .
In addition , substance P -@@ I fibers also extend from the BR@@ 1 into the entire BR@@ 2 .
For example , LAR mRNA is highly expressed by both proliferating and post@@ mitotic cells in the BR@@ 1 at embryonic day 17 and in all layers of the BR@@ 2 at postnatal day 4 .
To better understand the role played by SC@@ G@@ 10 and st@@ ath@@ min in vivo , we have analyzed the expression and localization of these proteins in both the BR@@ 1 epithelium and the BR@@ 2 in developing and adult rats , as well as in adult bul@@ bec@@ tomized rats .
In the BR@@ 1 of postnatal and adult rats , a moderate to strong SC@@ G@@ 10 immunoreactivity was present in the BR@@ 2 layer , whereas no labeling was detected in the glomerular layer .
In this study we assessed synapse density within the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 of Tg@@ 25@@ 76 mice at 6 @-@ 18 months of age using stere@@ ological methods at both the light and electron microscope levels .
Under light microscopy we failed to find overall decreases in the density of synaptophysin @-@ positive boutons in any brain areas selected , but bout@@ on density was significantly decreased within 200 mum of compact beta @-@ amyloid plaques in the outer molecular layer of the BR@@ 1 and L@@ ayers II and III of the BR@@ 2 at 15 @-@ 18 months of age in Tg 25@@ 76 mice .
Under electron microscopy , we found overall decreases in synapse density in the outer molecular layer of the BR@@ 1 at both 6 @-@ 9 and 15 @-@ 18 months of age , and in L@@ ayers II and III of the BR@@ 2 at 15 @-@ 18 months of age in Tg 25@@ 76 mice .
These results provide the first quantitative morphological evidence at the ultrastructure level of a spatial relationship between beta @-@ amyloid plaques and synapse loss within the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 of Tg@@ 25@@ 76 mice .

A cyto@@ architec@@ tonic par@@ cell@@ ation has been made of the BR@@ 1 and of the ad@@ joining parts of the BR@@ 2 in rhesus and squirrel monkeys .
In the &quot; second &quot; and &quot; third &quot; sensory areas , such as the BR@@ 1 and many of the BR@@ 2 , the density of the plexus and its co@@ arseness diminish slightly and the deeper half of layer IV becomes free of terminals .
in BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 ) there is labeling of the superficial half of layer VI .
Where layers V and VI become subdivided in the hom@@ otypical BR@@ 1 , the auditory and adjacent fields were only observed in cases in which the BR@@ 2 was involved by the injection of isotope .
The boundaries of the BR@@ 1 projection fields of individual BR@@ 2 , as determined autoradi@@ ographically , are remarkably sharp and invariably coincide with a sharp architec@@ tonic boundary or with a zone of maximal cyto@@ architec@@ tonic change .
As early as stage 33 , nit@@ re@@ r@@ gic cells were observed in the BR@@ 1 within the developing BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 was dissected from fetal rats and transplanted adjacent to the BR@@ 2 of newborn rats .
The projection from host BR@@ 1 ( particularly from BR@@ 2 ) was the den@@ s@@ est and most consistent projection .
Dor@@ m@@ ant basket cell &quot; hypothesis revisited : relative vulner@@ abilities of BR@@ 1 mossy cells and inhibitory interneurons after BR@@ 2 status epilepticus in the rat .
BR@@ 1 connections of the BR@@ 2 in the rhesus monkey .
The BR@@ 1 connections of different architec@@ tonic areas of the BR@@ 2 in the rhesus monkey were investigated with the aid of both anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques .
The BR@@ 1 projects to , and receives fibers from , BR@@ 2 , viz .
BR@@ 1 projection fibers in the monkey BR@@ 2 : a demonstration of the fiber pathways by retrograde axonal transport of WGA @-@ HRP .
On the other hand , the scatter of fibers from the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 progressed gradually through the nerve .
However , the BR@@ 1 fibers were located in the lateral periphery of the nerve , and they overlapped significantly with fibers from the BR@@ 2 .
Thus , the present findings based on more precise anatomical techniques indicate that the classical notion of the BR@@ 1 quadrant topography in the monkey BR@@ 2 probably is suspect .
Mean total cell labeling was less than 400 per BR@@ 1 , suggesting recruitment from a very small fraction of the neurons contained within the BR@@ 2 .
The mitral cell of the BR@@ 1 is the primary relay neuron that transm@@ its information from the BR@@ 2 receptors to the rest of the brain .
In vitro BR@@ 1 neurons and their dendrites from embryonic day 18 BR@@ 2 responded to t @-@ AC@@ PD and quis@@ qual@@ ate , selective and nonselective metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists , and to several ionotropic glutamate agonists with increases in intracellular Ca2 + as studied with fura @-@ 2 digital imaging .
The BR@@ 1 displays the most intense expression of parvalbumin within the BR@@ 2 .
We compare the distribution of calcium @-@ binding proteins in the di@@ encephalon of P@@ sam@@ mod@@ rom@@ us with other vertebrates , with mammals in particular , and suggest that the middle and ventral ti@@ ers of the rep@@ ti@@ li@@ an BR@@ 1 may be comparable to nonspecific or plur@@ im@@ odal BR@@ 2 in mammals , on the basis of the calcium @-@ binding protein expression patterns , as well as the h@@ od@@ ological and embry@@ ological data in the literature .
Post @-@ ro@@ lan@@ dic BR@@ 1 projections of the BR@@ 2 in the rhesus monkey .
The efferent connections of different cyto@@ architec@@ tonic areas of the BR@@ 1 in the rhesus monkey with BR@@ 2 were investigated using autoradiographic methods .
BR@@ 1 , in addition , were identified according to their cells of origin and the laterality of their BR@@ 2 projections after injection of tracer .
F@@ aint projections were demonstrated to the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 .
Unlike the sensorimotor apparatus controlling limb and body movements , the BR@@ 1 controlling the head and neck received prominent BR@@ 2 projections .
There is a correlation between axon number and mitral / tu@@ fted cell number during larval development that is consistent with the hypothesis that BR@@ 1 axons influence BR@@ 2 development .
Changes in tactile stimuli @-@ induced behavior and c @-@ Fos expression in the BR@@ 1 and in BR@@ 2 after sciatic nerve crush .
We have now investigated whether a sciatic nerve crush injury alters the behavioral response in rats to tactile stimuli and whether this is associated with a change in the pattern of c @-@ Fos expression in the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 .
C @-@ Fos expression in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 was never observed on brushing the skin of the sciatic nerve territory in animals with intact nerves , but was found after sciatic nerve crush with peripheral regeneration .
We conclude that after nerve injury , low threshold mechano@@ receptor fibers may play a major role in producing pain @-@ related behavior by activating normally nociceptive @-@ specific regions of the central nervous system such as the superficial laminae of the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 .
Evidence for segregated cortic@@ ocortical networks linking BR@@ 1 with the BR@@ 2 .
We have examined the circuitry connecting the BR@@ 1 with the BR@@ 2 of rhesus monkeys .
HRP @-@ WGA and tritiated amino acids were injected into BR@@ 1 , and anterograde and retrograde label was recorded within the BR@@ 2 .
Our main finding is that each BR@@ 1 is connected with a unique set of BR@@ 2 .
Here we show that relatively mature neurons generated from neuro@@ spheres derived from postnatal BR@@ 1 or BR@@ 2 undergo a phenotypic transformation into astrocytes that coincides with the appearance of a non@@ fused , hybrid cell type that shares the morphology , antigenicity , and physiology of both neurons and astrocytes .
Distribution of BR@@ 1 projections from BR@@ 2 lamina I neurons in the cat and the monkey .
The distribution of terminal projections in the BR@@ 1 from lamina I neurons in the BR@@ 2 was investigated with the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris @-@ leuc@@ o@@ agglutinin in the cat and the cynomolgus monkey .
These observations indicate that BR@@ 1 lamina I neurons project to a variety of BR@@ 2 involved in autonomic and homeostatic processing and the control of behavioral state .
The genetically determined loss of BR@@ 1 Purkinje cells in &quot; Purkinje cell degeneration &quot; mutant mice depri@@ ves BR@@ 2 neurons of their major postsynaptic target .
The BR@@ 1 appeared less affected than the BR@@ 2 .
Mot@@ oneur@@ ons innervating the pal@@ at@@ oglos@@ sus are located in the BR@@ 1 and , possibly , in BR@@ 2 .
Long @-@ term survival of centrally projecting axons in the BR@@ 1 of the frog following destruction of the BR@@ 2 .
At the end of various survival periods following unilateral removal of the BR@@ 1 , horseradish peroxidase was administered to the BR@@ 2 stump by a fiber @-@ filling method .
However , approximately 55@@ ,000 normal @-@ appearing unmyelinated axons persisted in the BR@@ 1 at 10 weeks following removal of the BR@@ 2 .
It is hypothesized that the potential shown by frog BR@@ 1 axons for long @-@ term survival in the absence of the cell @-@ body expresses a general property of vertebrate axons , rather than a special property of the frog BR@@ 2 .
Development of the rat BR@@ 1 : I. Mos@@ aic organization of the BR@@ 2 neuro@@ epithelium .
Short @-@ survival , sequential , and long @-@ survival thymidine radi@@ ograms of rat embryos , fetuses and young pups were analyzed in order to delineate the boundaries of the proliferative BR@@ 1 neuro@@ epithelium , describe its early transformations , identify its regional divisions , and , finally , attempt to relate its distinct neuro@@ epithelial components to specific BR@@ 2 that they supply with neurons .
In this introduc@@ tory paper , some evidence is presented in support of the hypothesis that the identified BR@@ 1 represent putative cell lines committed to produce neurons for specific , early @-@ generated BR@@ 2 .
The early derivatives of the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
The early derivatives of the BR@@ 1 are the BR@@ 2 .
Thus these data indicate a previously unrecognized topographic representation of the vertical dimension of the BR@@ 1 across BR@@ 2 iso@@ frequency laminae .
BR@@ 1 afferents to the rat BR@@ 2 : synaptic targets and relation to dopamine terminals .
In the present study , we investigated the ultrastructure and synaptic targets of BR@@ 1 terminals , as well as their relation to dopamine terminals within the BR@@ 2 of adult rats .
BR@@ 1 afferents were labeled either by anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin @-@ horseradish peroxidase from the BR@@ 2 or by anterograde degeneration following fimbri@@ a lesion .
BR@@ 1 terminals in the BR@@ 2 , identified by either method , formed primarily asymmetric ax@@ osp@@ inous synapses , with a small percentage forming asymmetric ax@@ odend@@ ritic synapses .
Thus , the contralateral BR@@ 1 showed a decrease , whereas the BR@@ 2 showed an increase in the synapse @-@ to @-@ neuron ratio compared with light @-@ reared , non@@ enucleated rats .
When enucleated rats were reared in the raised in either &quot; light &quot; or &quot; dark &quot; , there was a decrease in the ratio in both BR@@ 1 , although the extent of this decrease was more marked in the contralateral than the BR@@ 2 .
The maturation of the BR@@ 1 projections to the BR@@ 2 of the golden hamster has been traced by using the Fin@@ k @-@ He@@ imer silver technique to stain degenerating axons and terminal arbor@@ izations after bul@@ bectomy at different ages between birth and 33 days .
By five days of age the caudal region exhibiting a long @-@ lasting degeneration reaction extends from the middle of the BR@@ 1 to the middle of the BR@@ 2 .
Examination of thick serial sections and surface preparations with the differential interference contrast microscope allowed direct visualization of individually impregnated BR@@ 1 cells , complete with their peripheral processes and endings in the BR@@ 2 .
There are at least two types of BR@@ 1 cells in the BR@@ 2 of the infant cat and rat .
Hence , these ganglion cells establish nearly &quot; point @-@ to @-@ point &quot; connections between the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 .
The vagal potential underwent a phase reversal in the middle layers ; thus , the current sink site was cyto@@ architec@@ ton@@ ically identified as the BR@@ 1 or the BR@@ 2 , where no somatosensory input has previously been demonstrated .
Double @-@ labeling experiments show that the projections of the sub@@ esophageal @-@ caly@@ cal tract neurons do not overlap with the projections of the BR@@ 1 projection neurons and visual projection neurons from the BR@@ 2 .
Glycine @-@ immunoreactive projection of the cat BR@@ 1 : possible role in BR@@ 2 ear dominance .
Neurons in the BR@@ 1 are optimally excited by stimulation of the ipsilateral ear , as are those in the BR@@ 2 by stimulation of the contralateral ear .
Thus , there is a heavy unc@@ ros@@ sed projection from the cat BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 that may be glycin@@ ergic and inhibitory .
Positive fibers were also seen in the BR@@ 1 and in the BR@@ 2 .
The axons of the primary sensory BR@@ 1 neurons project from the BR@@ 2 lining the nasal cavity , onto glomeruli covering the surface of the olfactory bulb .
The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that phenotypically unique subsets of primary sensory BR@@ 1 neurons , scattered throughout the nasal cavity , project to a subset of glomeruli in specific BR@@ 2 loci .
These data demonstrated that a phenotypically distinct subset of primary sensory olfactory neurons exhibits a topographical projection from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 , and suggests that these , and other subsets , may form the basis of the mosaic nature of this pathway .
Moreover , it appears that the outer nerve fibre layer in the BR@@ 1 plays an important instruc@@ tive role in the guidance and fasc@@ ic@@ ulation of BR@@ 2 sensory axons .
In monkeys monoc@@ ularly treated with tetrodotoxin for 1 day to 2 weeks , both Nuclear respiratory factor 2 alpha expression and c oxidase activity were reduced in deprived BR@@ 1 and in deprived layers of the BR@@ 2 .
basic fibroblast growth factor stimulated DNA synthesis by 68 % in BR@@ 1 , and by &amp; gt ; 250 % in BR@@ 2 .
In contrast , incorporation was not altered in BR@@ 1 or BR@@ 2 , regions in which neurogenesis has already ceased .
These results suggest that the specific BR@@ 1 pathway sets up an excitatory synaptic activity in the BR@@ 2 of the irradiated animal .
In contrast to the strong innervation of BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 in mammal , the melanin @-@ concentrating hormone and hypoc@@ retin systems in goldfish barely innervate these aminergic populations related to the regulation of sleep and arousal .
melanin @-@ concentrating hormone , but not hypoc@@ retin , immunoreactive fibers terminate substantially in the sensory layer of the BR@@ 1 of goldfish , while both pepti@@ der@@ gic systems distribute to the BR@@ 2 .
In the BR@@ 1 , Nor@@ adrenaline @-@ immunoreactive BR@@ 2 -@@ contacting neurons are located in the same regions where dop@@ amin@@ e- and serotonin @-@ containing cerebrospinal fluid contacting neurons occur .
Interestingly , Nor@@ adrenaline @-@ immunoreactive fibers form large club endings in some subdivisions of the BR@@ 1 , and parallel fibers in the BR@@ 2 granular layer .
Comparison with the distribution of Nor@@ adrenaline @-@ immunoreactive or dopamine @-@ beta @-@ hydroxylase @-@ immunoreactivity in other species shows that all tele@@ osts studied to date have noradrenergic cells in the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 .
However , Nor@@ adrenaline @-@ immunoreactive BR@@ 1 -@@ contacting BR@@ 2 cells have been described only in the teleost Gn@@ ath@@ on@@ em@@ us pe@@ ter@@ sii and the lizard Ge@@ k@@ ko g@@ eck@@ o ( S@@ meets and Ste@@ in@@ bus@@ ch : J. Com@@ p .
It is possible that they might pic@@ k up catecholamines as well as serotonin from the BR@@ 1 , into which mono@@ amines might be released by BR@@ 2 axonal plex@@ uses .
Compared with workers , they all have large eyes , relatively larger BR@@ 1 , smaller BR@@ 2 , and similarly sized anten@@ nal lobes .
The input regions of the BR@@ 1 , the lip and the collar , generally correlate with the size of the BR@@ 2 , respectively .
For instance , the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 mostly contained thick axons that contributed clusters of large @-@ sized varicosities , each forming multiple asymmetric synapses , usually with vesicle @-@ filled dendrites .
Because the BR@@ 1 does not project to the BR@@ 2 , this labeling had to arise from a neuronal population with branching axons to both structures .
Previous findings pointed to three possible sources : BR@@ 1 mono@@ aminergic cells , intral@@ amin@@ ar BR@@ 2 neurons , and cortico@@ striatal cells .
Therefore , we concluded that the BR@@ 1 anterograde labeling originated from cortico@@ striatal neurons , with axons branching to the BR@@ 2 .
A systematic representation of the contralateral body surface was found in BR@@ 1 ad@@ joining the first somatosensory representation , BR@@ 2 .
The representation of the body in BR@@ 1 was found to be much less distorted than in BR@@ 2 .
This orientation allows BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 to be ad@@ joined along a common border representing the top of the head and face .
After iontoph@@ oretic deposits of biotinylated dextran amine in the area of the BR@@ 1 , many biotinylated dextran amine -@@ labeled terminals in the BR@@ 2 were immunoreactive for enkephalin and vesicular glutamate transporter @-@ 2 .
Thus , we have studied the membrane availability and intran@@ eur@@ onal distribution of the m2 muscarinic auto@@ receptor in cholinergic neurons of the BR@@ 1 projecting to the BR@@ 2 .
The cerebell@@ o @-@ pul@@ vin@@ ar fibers were found to arise mainly from the BR@@ 1 and to terminate contral@@ aterally in a narrow area at the extreme BR@@ 2 at the level of the stere@@ otax@@ ic frontal plane A @-@ 7.0 .
The area of terminal ram@@ ification of retin@@ o @-@ pul@@ vin@@ ar fibers was seen as a thin sheet lying at the extreme BR@@ 1 through most of the BR@@ 2 , bilaterally with contralateral predominance .
The BR@@ 1 did not seem to overlap with the BR@@ 2 area ; the former appeared to be contiguous ventro@@ laterally to the latter .
Collectively , these findings indicate that glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the zebrafish BR@@ 1 and that ionotropic glutamate receptor subtypes function heterogene@@ ously in the BR@@ 2 neurons .
Pyr@@ amidal neurons in the mouse BR@@ 1 were labeled by the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase injected into the BR@@ 2 .
To avoid confusion , terminals in BR@@ 1 labeled by the anterograde transport of horseradish peroxidase injected into BR@@ 2 were eliminated by lesion @-@ induced degeneration .
Although the descending projections were bilateral with an ipsilateral dominance , BR@@ 1 received a more dominant ipsilateral projection than BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 , which is located in the BR@@ 2 , supplies the muscul@@ i rec@@ ti inferior and medi@@ alis and the musculus obliqu@@ us inferior without a clear somat@@ otopic representation of the motoneurons .
The BR@@ 1 , which rostr@@ ally jo@@ ins the BR@@ 2 with a gap of only about 40 micron between the nuclei , is situated completely contralateral to the musculus obliqu@@ us superior supplied by it .
Dend@@ r@@ ites of the BR@@ 1 and of the BR@@ 2 extend into neuropil areas receiving primary sensory afferents .
Ax@@ otomy induces a different modulation of both low @-@ affinity nerve growth factor receptor and choline acetyltransferase between adult rat BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 motoneurons .
Adult rat BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 motoneurons re @-@ express low @-@ affinity nerve growth factor receptor after their axotomy .
Results of these previous studies differed regarding the type of the most effective triggering injury for p75 re@@ expression , the relative duration of this re@@ expression and the decrease of choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity following a permanent axotomy of BR@@ 1 or BR@@ 2 motoneurons .
This evidence indicates that BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 motoneurons respond to a permanent axotomy with a different modulation of p75 and choline acetyltransferase expression .
In colchicine @-@ treated turtles and pigeons , numerous calcitonin @-@ gene @-@ related peptide + perikarya were observed in the BR@@ 1 of the BR@@ 2 ( n .
Injections of fluoro@@ gold into the BR@@ 1 combined with immunofluorescence labeling for calcitonin @-@ gene @-@ related peptide revealed that calcitonin @-@ gene @-@ related peptide + cells in these areas do , in fact , project to the BR@@ 2 .
These include the possibility that BR@@ 1 projections to the BR@@ 2 arose independently in the lines of evolution leading to mammals and sa@@ uro@@ p@@ sids .
Dual immunostaining for Flu@@ oro @-@ Gold and ER alpha or Flu@@ oro @-@ Gold and androgen receptors showed that over one @-@ third of BR@@ 1 efferen@@ ts to the BR@@ 2 contain receptors for either estrogen or androgen .
In addition , approximately 50 % of BR@@ 1 neurons retrogradely labeled from the BR@@ 2 were immunoreactive for either ER alpha or androgen receptors .
The BR@@ 1 projection of the BR@@ 2 in the rat : a retrograde fluorescent dye study .
The fluorescent dye , retrograde labeling technique was used to determine the extent of the projection from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 in the rat .
An analysis of the results demonstrates that the projection to the BR@@ 1 arises in the medial neurons within the BR@@ 2 .
This projection is directed to the BR@@ 1 , but not to the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 receives a BR@@ 2 projection which originates from neurons in two areas , the medial part of the anterior one @-@ third of the nucleus and the center portion of the posterior two @-@ thirds of the nucleus .
These results demonstrate that the BR@@ 1 gives rise to a rather widespread and top@@ ographically organized projection to the BR@@ 2 of the rat .
Some of the fine fibers in the BR@@ 1 appeared to be collaterals of thicker fibers that terminated in the BR@@ 2 .
The labeling was more sparse than that observed in the BR@@ 1 after larger BR@@ 2 injections but displayed the same morphological characteristics .
The Phaseolus vulgaris leuc@@ o@@ agglutinin observations were corroborated by the presence of many retrogradely labeled lamina I cells at both BR@@ 1 , following injections of cholera toxin subunit b or rhodamine @-@ labeled microspheres in the BR@@ 2 .
These observations indicate that the BR@@ 1 receives input from lamina I neurons , and probably from lamina III @-@ V neurons as well , at BR@@ 2 .
The lamina I input could also be responsible for the general inhibition of lateral BR@@ 1 neurons by wide @-@ field noxious stimulation , via activation of GABAergic interneurons in the BR@@ 2 .
This study examined the morphology of individual BR@@ 1 terminals that were filled with horseradish peroxidase by injections in the optic tract or BR@@ 2 .
These immunoreactive cells move outside the BR@@ 1 to form the ganglion of the BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 @-@ projecting vas@@ opres@@ sin@@ ergic neurons in the rat BR@@ 2 .
This may be exerted by neurons in the BR@@ 1 with BR@@ 2 projections .
In this study , we have analyzed the distribution of BR@@ 1 @-@ projecting BR@@ 2 neurons that express vasopressin , an important neuropeptide in autonomic regulation .
More than 40 % of the BR@@ 1 projecting neurons in the BR@@ 2 of naive Sprague @-@ Dawley rats were found to express vasopressin mRNA .
The BR@@ 1 displayed large numbers of vasopressin mRNA @-@ expressing neurons , but very few of those projected to the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 contained a large number of BR@@ 2 projecting neurons , but very few of those expressed vasopressin mRNA .
This provides an anatomical basis for a selective activation of functionally different groups in the BR@@ 1 as part of a behaviorally adaptive response , including modulation of autonomic activity and pain processing at the BR@@ 2 level .
Brain sections cut parallel to the BR@@ 1 revealed myelin @-@ light septa that isolated representations of the digits and parts of the face , teeth , and tongue in BR@@ 2 of adult and infant macaque monkeys .
A reticular pattern of intrinsic connections in primate BR@@ 1 ( BR@@ 2 ) .
A system of periodic intrinsic connections is demonstrated in BR@@ 1 ( BR@@ 2 ) of squirrel and macaque monkeys by large injections of tritiated amino acids , horseradish peroxidase , and fluorescent latex beads .
As in BR@@ 1 , the tangential configuration of these connections in BR@@ 2 is reticular or lat@@ ti@@ celi@@ ke , and is detectable for 2.5 @-@ 3.0 mm from an injection site of horseradish peroxidase , 3H amino acids , or latex beads .
Other extrinsic connections , however , such as back@@ going connections from BR@@ 1 to BR@@ 2 , do not seem to have a periodic distribution .
Organization of visual cortico@@ striatal projections in the cat , with observations on visual projections to BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
Retrograde tracer deposits into the visual recipient zone of the BR@@ 1 reveal substantial convergence of other BR@@ 2 inputs to this same domain .
Aspects of visu@@ otopic organization are preserved in the visual projections to both the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 , but unequivocal retin@@ otopic organization could not be inferred from the available material .
Ten of the eleven BR@@ 1 also project top@@ ographically onto the visual zone of the BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 afferents to the BR@@ 2 in the cat : a horseradish peroxidase study .
Om@@ ni@@ pause &quot; neurons , located in the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 , actively suppress saccadic eye movements during inter@@ saccadic intervals .
To determine the BR@@ 1 afferents that may inhibit the OP@@ Ns and thereby allow a saccade to occur , we injected horseradish peroxidase into the BR@@ 2 of four cats at the site of physiologically identified OP@@ Ns .
A few neurons were labeled in a restricted region of the causal part of the BR@@ 1 and in the BR@@ 2 .
Larger numbers of neurons were labeled in the BR@@ 1 and in parts of the BR@@ 2 .
The best prospects for a saccade initiation signal from one of the labeled populations appear to be the BR@@ 1 and / or the BR@@ 2 .
In the present study , we investigated the expression profiles and activity levels of ligands and receptors of the Transforming growth factor @-@ beta and bone morphogenetic protein 4 family during the physiological programmed cell death periods of the developing chick and mouse BR@@ 1 and possible interactions of both proapoptotic molecules in mediating apoptosis in chick and murine BR@@ 2 whole @-@ mount cultures .
Retrograde trans@@ ganglionic transport of HRP revealed somat@@ ot@@ opy within the BR@@ 1@@ e : the delicate nerve fibres innervating the chem@@ osensory anterior dorsal fin terminate exclusively in a distinct , dorsal portion of the BR@@ 2 .
Anti@@ sera to GAD and GABA were used to determine the distribution of GABAergic cells and terminals in the BR@@ 1 and midbrain BR@@ 2 of the bar@@ n owl .
In the time pathway , all the cells of the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 receive per@@ is@@ omatic GABAergic terminals , and small numbers of GABAergic neurons surround both nuclei .
BR@@ 1 epilepsy is often associated with pathological changes in the BR@@ 2 , and such changes may be more common in humans than in some non@@ primate species .
These noradrenergic projection neurons were located not only in the BR@@ 1 but also in the BR@@ 2 , including the A5 and A7 cell groups .
We examined the morphology and distribution of retrogradely labeled spin@@ oth@@ al@@ amic tract neurons in lamina I of the BR@@ 1 after large injections of cholera toxin subunit B or Fast Blue into the BR@@ 2 of cats .
De@@ generation experiments reveal that the BR@@ 1 of the adult opos@@ sum distrib@@ utes to an extensive and diverse area of the BR@@ 2 and , as in placental mammals , the traditionally named nuclei do not receive a uniform distribution of primary afferent fibers .
Regeneration of BR@@ 1 axons into the goldfish BR@@ 2 .
The growth of regenerating BR@@ 1 axons into the central portion of the BR@@ 2 of adult goldfish was examined with the light and electron microscop@@ es .
Re@@ generating axons appear in very large numbers and travel in fasc@@ icles in the BR@@ 1 and in the adjacent neuropil , the BR@@ 2 .
Ac@@ cess@@ ory optic system of an anthro@@ po@@ id primate , the gib@@ bon : evidence of a direct BR@@ 1 input to the BR@@ 2 .
The course of the accessory optic tract and the BR@@ 1 projection to the BR@@ 2 are described in the gib@@ bon and compared to that of other mammals .
In contrast to previous reports in hapl@@ orh@@ ine primates , which describe the accessory optic system as consisting of only the BR@@ 1 , we find that in the gib@@ bon , three cellular groups receive a bilateral projection , predominantly from the BR@@ 2 .
According to cyto@@ architecture and topographic location , two of these nuclei correspond to the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 .
There was no evidence for a ventral division of the BR@@ 1 , which in non@@ primates is typically situated at the BR@@ 2 .
Examination of brain morphology in primates suggests that the BR@@ 1 has been displaced from its phylogenetically stable location in the BR@@ 2 to a more dorsal position .
BR@@ 1 projects upon a belt of neurons within the overlying BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 projects , in turn , upon a region of BR@@ 2 containing cell bodies of the occip@@ ito @-@ mesencephalic tract .
Organization and morphologies of acetylcholinesterase @-@ containing neurons in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 of the rat .
The distribution and morphologies of neurons containing acetyl cholinesterase in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 of the rat were studied by means of a pharmac@@ o @-@ histochemical technique involving staining for acetyl cholinesterase at various times after administration of bis @-@ phosphoro@@ fluor@@ idate .
The strongest acetyl cholinesterase activity occurring at the level of the BR@@ 1 is found within the small , round to oval , somata of BR@@ 2 .
Most of the BR@@ 1 , as well as BR@@ 2 , are composed of medium @-@ sized multi@@ polar neurons displaying moderate to strong acetyl cholinesterase activity .
Moder@@ ately stained acetyl cholinesterase neurons are also found in BR@@ 1 and in BR@@ 2 .
At the level of the BR@@ 1 , the neurons of BR@@ 2 show strong acetyl cholinesterase activity .
The acetyl cholinesterase neurons of BR@@ 1 are surrounded by numerous acetyl cholinesterase -containing processes of some large BR@@ 2 neurons that stain intensely for the enzyme .
Retrograde tracing , with either horse @-@ ra@@ dish peroxidase or rhodamine @-@ labelled microspheres , indicated a significant increase in the number of neurons projecting to the BR@@ 1 from the BR@@ 2 of lesioned animals .
The increase was largely confined to the rostral extent of the BR@@ 1 , and overlapped the distribution of cells labelled after injections of HRP into BR@@ 2 of control and lesioned animals .
These findings demonstrate that removal of dopamine afferents during development leads to an enlargement of the seroton@@ inergic projection from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 .
Sur@@ ro@@ unding these fields is a belt of BR@@ 1 in which units are generally less responsive to acoustic stimulation and the frequency organization is more complex than in AI or R. Electrophysiological and cyto@@ architec@@ tonic evidence suggest that this belt is composed of at least three and possibly four separate BR@@ 2 .
Specifically , tr@@ kB and neurotrophin @-@ 3 mRNA elevations were restricted to granule cells in the BR@@ 1 , whereas bilateral increases in tr@@ k@@ C , brain @-@ derived neurotrophic factor , and nerve growth factor mRNA levels occurred in granule cells and BR@@ 2 pyramidal cells .
Golgi @-@ impregnated , linear@@ ized BR@@ 1 were sectioned serially in one of the three BR@@ 2 planes .
Three days after treatment , a significant dose @-@ dependent increase in Hsp@@ 27 @-@ immunoreactive proto@@ plasmic astrocytes was found in the BR@@ 1 , and in the BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
The largest portion of the BR@@ 1 is located dorsal to the BR@@ 2 .
We have now identified a novel third population of olfactory marker protein @-@ expressing sensory neurons that is located in a discrete pocket of the BR@@ 1 , which we refer to as the BR@@ 2 .
Despite their unusual location , axons projecting from the BR@@ 1 neurons fasc@@ iculate into several discrete bundles and terminate in a subset of BR@@ 2 glomeruli .
The connections of the BR@@ 1 with BR@@ 2 neurons of the oculomotor and collim@@ otor systems in the pigeon were delineated in experiments using WGA @-@ HRP as an anterograde and retrograde tracer .
The retrograde data indicate that ipsilateral projections upon BR@@ 1 neurons arise from the BR@@ 2 .
Pro@@ jec@@ tions upon BR@@ 1 neurons arise primarily from neurons in the BR@@ 2 .
With the exception of BR@@ 1 , BR@@ 2 projecting to neck motoneurons also project to extraocular motoneurons .
Exposure to 3H @-@ Td@@ R given at E@@ 36 labels a few neurons in the deep@@ est layers of the BR@@ 1 , and 3H @-@ Td@@ R given at E@@ 38 labels a small number of neurons in all BR@@ 2 .
Post@@ mitotic neurons migrate from a zone near the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 .
The number of glial fibrillary acidic protein -positive cells in the BR@@ 1 increased steadily with time so that , by P@@ 26 , glial fibrillary acidic protein -@@ immunoreactive astrocytes were distributed evenly through all BR@@ 2 laminae .
The distribution of the BR@@ 1 efferen@@ ts to the BR@@ 2 is unique in the flat@@ fish .
In the BR@@ 1 , two bands of degeneration remained over the BR@@ 2 .
Distinct layer was lacking in the BR@@ 1 with a conspic@@ u@@ ously absent large cell layer in the BR@@ 2 .
Postnatal changes in the number of astrocytes , oligodendrocytes , and microglia in the BR@@ 1 ( BR@@ 2 ) of the macaque monkey : a stere@@ ological analysis in normal and monoc@@ ularly deprived animals .
Using measurements o@@ BR@@ 1 thickness and surface area , the total number of cells in the BR@@ 2 of one hemisphere was derived for each glial cell type .
These changes , however , were only a response to a substantial over@@ shoot in BR@@ 1 volume at six months : the total number of astrocytes in the BR@@ 2 did not change .
Olfactory sensory neuron axonal extension and targeting occur within the BR@@ 1 layer of the BR@@ 2 .
The data demonstrate that , as Olfactory sensory neuron axons begin to exit the BR@@ 1 layer o and target a specific region of the BR@@ 2 , there is a down @-@ regulation of cytoskeletal elements and bound extracellular adhesion molecules .
These BR@@ 1 units change progressively in cyto@@ architecture from the lateral to the BR@@ 2 .
The first two unit types display prominently two additional components of the feline BR@@ 1 -@@ namely , clusters of dwarf cells and small pyramidal @-@ like neurons constituting the den@@ s@@ ocellular layer cup@@ ping the base of BR@@ 2 .
In the BR@@ 1 , satellite neurons are most conspicuous in granule @-@ cell @-@ poor spaces within the BR@@ 2 , where many non @-@ granular neurons are un@@ characteristically small and chromoph@@ obic .
The BR@@ 1 itself is unusual not only for its large size but for lateral extensions enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ing a group of BR@@ 2 neurons far caud@@ ally .
Such extensions are one of several indications that the BR@@ 1 is intimately associated with the BR@@ 2 .
Hair cell regeneration is well documented in the BR@@ 1 sensory epithelia of lower vertebrates and birds and may occur in the BR@@ 2 of mammals .
The somat@@ otopic organization of primary afferent terminals in the superficial laminae of the BR@@ 1 of the rat BR@@ 2 .
The subdivisions of the sciatic nerve , the sural , lateral sural , superficial peroneal , and tibial nerves each projected to a separate and distinct region of the BR@@ 1 and collectively formed a &quot; U &quot; -@@ shaped zone of terminal labeling extending from BR@@ 2 L2 to the caudal portions of L5 .
In the larval and adult BR@@ 1 , both melan@@ op@@ sins are expressed in a subset of cells in the BR@@ 2 , resembling amacrine and ganglion cells .
The Golgi impregnated neurons in BR@@ 1 are typical of other BR@@ 2 and are not qualitatively different in the two subdivisions .
The distributions of orph@@ anin FQ and its cognate receptor , opioid receptor @-@ like receptor @-@ 1 , overlap steroid @-@ responsive regions throughout reproductive circuits of the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
We studied estrogen and progesterone regulation of OF@@ Q / N and NO@@ P mRNA expression in BR@@ 1 @-@ BR@@ 2 reproductive circuits .
In the BR@@ 1 , estrogen increased OF@@ Q / N mRNA levels , and progesterone did not alter this increase , whereas , in the BR@@ 2 , estrogen and progesterone were needed to increase OF@@ Q / N mRNA levels .
Steroid regulation of OF@@ Q / N and NO@@ P in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 is consistent with emerging data indicating that this opioid system regulates female reproduction .
In the BR@@ 1 all parts of the BR@@ 2 were found to contain catecholamines .
In the BR@@ 1 was the most heavily innervated area , followed by the BR@@ 2 , which contains the majority of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons innervating the pelvic organs .
Following a crush lesion of the BR@@ 1 , there was no cell loss in BR@@ 2 of normal adult mice , but 40 % cell loss occurred in O@@ la mice and the survivors increased in size during the period when functional reinnervation was established .
Development of BR@@ 1 topography in BR@@ 2 of normal and enucleated rats .
Moreover , BR@@ 1 input spec@@ ifies the topography of BR@@ 2 projections by postnatal day 6 .
After restricted intracortical injections of anter@@ ogr@@ ad@@ ely and retrogradely transported tracers we observed that the normal , non@@ mirror @-@ symmetric BR@@ 1 map , as well as the anomalous , mirror @-@ symmetric map observed in neon@@ atally enucleated animals , are present by P6 @-@ 7 , just as collateral branches of simple architecture emerge from their parental axons and grow into superficial BR@@ 2 layers .
Our results therefore do not support the idea that BR@@ 1 input guides BR@@ 2 map formation by primarily promoting the large @-@ scale elimination of long , non@@ topographic branches and arb@@ ors .
Instead , they suggest that BR@@ 1 input spec@@ ifies the sites on the parental axons from which interstitial branches will grow to invade middle and upper BR@@ 2 layers , thereby ensuring that the location of invading interstitial branches is accurately related to the topographical location of the soma that gives rise to the parental axon .
The postnatal development of a population of BR@@ 1 projecting BR@@ 2 ganglion cells with large somata in hamsters aged from postnatal day 4 to adult was studied by the intracellular injection of Luc@@ ifer Yellow .

In the rostral part of the BR@@ 1 they were confined to lamina V and in the BR@@ 2 and in cervical segments they were confined to lamina III / IV .
The differential laminar distribution of collateral arb@@ ors of single axons along the ro@@ stro@@ caudal axis distinguishes the BR@@ 1 from the BR@@ 2 where functional types of mechano@@ receptive afferents form continuous or interrupted sagittal columns of terminal arb@@ ors that do not shift dor@@ so@@ ventr@@ ally within segments .

The BR@@ 1 was divided into several neuro@@ meres : the BR@@ 2 became apparent first , then the portion rostral to this sulcus was subdivided into two portions by the syn @-@ paren@@ cephalic boundary .
Region @-@ specific activation of microglial cells in the rat BR@@ 1 following BR@@ 2 transection .
In the BR@@ 1 containing the degenerating terminals of BR@@ 2 fibers transected by fimbri@@ a @-@ fornix transection , a heavy reaction of lectin @-@ labeled activated microglial cells associated with high phagocyt@@ otic activity was noticed .
Unexpectedly , after a long survival time following BR@@ 1 transection , we observed an increase in microglial G@@ SA I @-@ B4 labeling in the BR@@ 2 .
a strong initial reaction in the BR@@ 1 and very little microglial activation in the BR@@ 2 , was observed after immun@@ ole@@ sioning .
Our results indicate that the microglial reaction in the BR@@ 1 following BR@@ 2 transection differs substantially from that seen in other models of axotomy .
Ultrastructural studies of hair cells and nerve terminals in the BR@@ 1 , the BR@@ 2 , were carried out with transmission and scanning electron microscop@@ es .
The projections of BR@@ 1 were determined by the intra @-@ axonal transport of 3H @-@ proline , 3H @-@ acetyl @-@ wheat germ agglutinin , and horseradish peroxidase after BR@@ 2 injections .
Single injections in BR@@ 1 sometimes produced label in two separate regions in the BR@@ 2 , suggesting that functional subdivisions exist in this projection zone .
A major feedback projection of BR@@ 1 was to BR@@ 2 .
Ax@@ onal trajectory and terminal distribution of inspiratory neurons of the BR@@ 1 in the cat &apos;s BR@@ 2 .
One branch crossed the midline to project to the BR@@ 1 , and the other , thinner branch descended caud@@ ally in the BR@@ 2 without distrib@@ uting any terminals .
The axon of the second type projected to the BR@@ 1 and distributed collateral branches with terminal boutons in the BR@@ 2 .
The third type projected to the BR@@ 1 and distributed terminal boutons in the BR@@ 2 and its vicinity .
The fourth type distributed numerous branches with terminal boutons in and around the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 area .
Only a small proportion of tyrosine hydroxylase @-@ like immunoreactive neurons in the BR@@ 1 , rostral linear nucleus , and BR@@ 2 contained NADPH diaphorase activity .
The other cell type was a bi@@ stratified cell with processes in both BR@@ 1 1 and BR@@ 2 .
Computer @-@ assisted analysis confirmed the location of substance P @-@ containing processes at 5 @-@ 15 % ( BR@@ 1 ) and 50 @-@ 70 % ( BR@@ 2 ) depth levels in the inner plexiform layer .
Whereas immunoreactivity was conspicuous in the ganglia of nerv@@ us terminalis , a weak reaction was detected in some granule cells in the BR@@ 1 and in the cells of BR@@ 2 .
In normal frontal sections of the BR@@ 1 , five columns of fibers surrounded by neuronal cell bodies could be clearly distinguished , but the number is probably for@@ tu@@ it@@ ous , for there was no one @-@ on @-@ one relationship with the five BR@@ 2 ganglia .
In addition , a dense bundle of long varicose processes projecting ro@@ stro@@ caud@@ ally was observed cour@@ sing along the ventral surface of the brain from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 .

BR@@ 1 input to the BR@@ 2 in the macaque monkey : potential substrate for parkinsonian tremor .
The BR@@ 1 input was directed mostly to the BR@@ 2 and cells just caudal to it .
To verify this apparent dependence of parvalbumin expression on Purkinje cell input in the BR@@ 1 , the patterns of expression in five other BR@@ 2 mutants with differing grades and chron@@ ologies of Purkinje cell loss were compared .
In st@@ agg@@ ere@@ r mice , neurons immunopositive for parvalbumin as well as for Cal@@ bindin D @-@ 28@@ k were present in BR@@ 1 , likely representing ectopic Purkinje cell s rather than BR@@ 2 neurons .
The axons of two groups of Man@@ duc@@ a sex@@ ta all@@ at@@ ostatin -@@ immunoreactive neurosecretory cells in the BR@@ 1 form part of the BR@@ 2 .

The results suggest that glutamate release from axon terminals of projection fibers from BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 is regulated pres@@ yn@@ ap@@ tically and differentially through mGlu@@ R2 / 3 , mGlu@@ R@@ 7a , and / or mGlu@@ R@@ 8 .
The BR@@ 1 also had numerous dendritic bundles extending across the midline , linking the BR@@ 2 bilaterally .
In additional experiments , the afferent projections to the BR@@ 1 were examined , providing an anatomical description of the ton@@ ot@@ op@@ icity of the BR@@ 2 .
Dep@@ os@@ its of horseradish peroxidase in the DPD labeled cells in each of the BR@@ 1 that have previously been shown to project to the entire BR@@ 2 .
When deposits of horseradish peroxidase were made into other frequency band representations of the BR@@ 1 , in either the BR@@ 2 , labeled cells again formed s@@ labs in each lower nucleus .

Terminal arb@@ ors from BR@@ 1 occupied intermediate positions in the BR@@ 2 .
Sept@@ otemporal distribution of BR@@ 1 projections to the BR@@ 2 in the cat : electrophysiological evidence .
The projection of the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 in the cat has been studied by electrophysiological methods .
Unit activity elicited by BR@@ 1 stimulation was measured in the BR@@ 2 .
Assuming that the sites of maximal AEP amplitude correspond to the location of the major synaptic inputs , it can be concluded that the active synaptic inputs arising along a BR@@ 1 are distributed within the BR@@ 2 according to a sep@@ tot@@ emporal axis , although with some overlap between the different projections .
Therefore it may be concluded that the BR@@ 1 is not homogeneous with respect to the inputs from the BR@@ 2 .
Purkinje cells in the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 are ze@@ br@@ in II@@ - .
Ze@@ br@@ in II antigenicity is first present at 6 days post@@ spawning in the BR@@ 1 and at P8 in the BR@@ 2 .
Additionally , E@@ igen@@ man@@ nia has a third class of Purkinje cells , in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 , that never express ze@@ br@@ in II immunoreactivity , indicating that ze@@ br@@ in II expression is not an obligatory feature of Purkinje cell development in all vertebrates .
Distribution of noradrenaline immunoreactivity in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 of the lizard Ge@@ k@@ ko g@@ eck@@ o .
The distribution of noradrenaline immunoreactivity in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 of the lizard Ge@@ k@@ ko g@@ eck@@ o was studied by means of recently developed antibodies against noradrenaline .
Nor@@ adrenaline @-@ containing cell bodies are found in the BR@@ 1 and ependymal wall of the BR@@ 2 .
Nor@@ adrenaline @-@ immunoreactive fibers and varicosities are widely , but not uniformly , distributed throughout the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
Moder@@ ately dense plex@@ uses of noradrenaline i fibers are found in the small @-@ cell@@ ed medial cortex , the BR@@ 1 , and the midbrain BR@@ 2 .
The remaining BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 areas are generally not or only spar@@ sely innervated by noradrenaline i fibers .
A remarkable exception is that the cells in the BR@@ 1 and ependymal wall of the BR@@ 2 are immun@@ onegative for dopamine @-@ beta @-@ hydroxylase .
De@@ generating pall@@ id@@ oth@@ al@@ amic projections emerging from the BR@@ 1 formed two diffuse groups of fibers ; one cour@@ sed ventro@@ medi@@ ally directly through the BR@@ 2 without forming a len@@ ticular fasc@@ iculus and terminated uniformly in the reticular , VA , VD , VM and the medial part of the VE .
The ot@@ e@@ hr group cour@@ sed ventro@@ laterally in the BR@@ 1 and , without forming an an@@ sa len@@ ticul@@ aris , entered the BR@@ 2 , sw@@ ept medi@@ ally through and ventral to the medial lem@@ n@@ is@@ cus , and terminated in the medial part of the VE and throughout the VD .
A similar pattern of C@@ iliary neurotrophic factor R alpha @-@ ir was seen within all BR@@ 1 with general somatic efferent function ( BR@@ 2 ) .
A few C@@ iliary neurotrophic factor R alpha @-@ ir neurons were seen within the BR@@ 1 with concomitant terminal @-@ like staining within the BR@@ 2 .
Autonomic regions such as the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 also contained C@@ iliary neurotrophic factor R alpha @-@ ir neurons .
Finally , the hippocampus displayed dense C@@ iliary neurotrophic factor R alpha @-@ ir within the pyramidal cell layer of the BR@@ 1 and the granule cell layer of the BR@@ 2 .
Aff@@ eren@@ t fibers of the BR@@ 1 terminate in the BR@@ 2 .
Most afferent fibers of the BR@@ 1 terminate in the sensory layer of the BR@@ 2 , in which degenerating terminals occur in some laminae .
Asc@@ ending secondary fibers from the BR@@ 1 project bilaterally to the BR@@ 2 in the isthmus region .
Desc@@ ending secondary fibers from the BR@@ 1 turn caud@@ ally in the BR@@ 2 .
These fibers terminate mostly in the BR@@ 1 and spar@@ sely in the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 give rise to the long and short secondary paths .
The short path includes secondary fibers projecting to the motor layer of the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 .
The spatiotemporal distribution of cell death in the chick embryo BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 was examined between stage ( St .
One region , the dorsal p@@ yc@@ no@@ tic zone , was located in the most dorsal part of the BR@@ 1 , including the BR@@ 2 , with the highest number of p@@ yc@@ no@@ tic cells observed at stage ( St .
The afferent and efferent projections of a BR@@ 1 , the BR@@ 2 , were mapped out in a par@@ rot , the bud@@ ger@@ ig@@ ar to determine the relationships of this nucleus to the auditory system .
BR@@ 1 has also been shown to receive input from neurons in the immediately adjacent BR@@ 2 ( Dur@@ and et al . &#91; 1997 &#93; J. Com@@ p .
Thus , the focus of the present study was to elucidate relationships between BR@@ 1 , its immediately adjacent surround and BR@@ 2 .
Neurons in the BR@@ 1 immediately medial to BR@@ 2 project to a shell region around the entire nucleus .
Interestingly , elevated levels of GI@@ RK2 protein in the Ts@@ 65@@ D@@ n BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 correlated with elevated levels of GI@@ R@@ K1 protein .
This suggests that heter@@ omeric GI@@ R@@ K1 @-@ GI@@ RK2 channels are overexpressed in Ts@@ 65@@ D@@ n BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 , which could impair excitatory input and modulate spike frequency and synaptic kinetics in the affected regions .
However , in the Ts@@ 65@@ D@@ n mouse a strong immunofluorescent staining of GI@@ RK2 was detected in the lacun@@ osum molecular layer of the BR@@ 1 of the BR@@ 2 .
In addition , tyrosine hydroxylase containing dopaminergic neurons that co@@ express GI@@ RK2 were more numerous in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 in the Ts@@ 65@@ D@@ n compared to diploid controls .
Double @-@ label retrograde transport techniques were used to label cells projecting to BR@@ 1 with one fluorescent dye and to label cells projecting to BR@@ 2 with a different dye .
Following injections into the two BR@@ 1 , some cells were double labeled and some were single labeled in all three BR@@ 2 studied .
However , the relative number of double@@ - and single @-@ labeled cells , as well as the relative number of cells single @-@ labeled following injections into each BR@@ 1 , differed among the three BR@@ 2 .
In both BR@@ 1 and the C @-@ laminae of the BR@@ 2 , the number of double @-@ labeled cells was small .
In contrast , a relatively large number of cells were single labeled with the dye placed in BR@@ 1 , especially in the C @-@ laminae of the BR@@ 2 .
In BR@@ 1 , many cells were labeled after the BR@@ 2 injections .
This indicates that almost all BR@@ 1 cells that project to one BR@@ 2 also project to the other via a bifur@@ c@@ ating axon .
BR@@ 1 terminals of the three spontaneous rate groups differ in caliber and synaptic position around the inner hair cell ; central terminals differ in degree of branching and in which subregions of the BR@@ 2 are targeted ( Lib@@ er@@ man &#91; 1991 &#93; J. Com@@ p .
In BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 , three defined bands of diffuse nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase staining were located in layer 2 and in upper and deep layer 5 .
From BR@@ 1 thickness data and neuronal N estimates , the absolute number of neurones under 1 mm2 of BR@@ 2 have been derived .
The re@@ organizations of the overall intrinsic glutamatergic and gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid -@@ ergic BR@@ 1 networks as well as the time course of these re@@ organizations during development of pilocarpine @-@ induced BR@@ 2 epilepsy were studied with in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry experiments for the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 and the vesicular gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid transporter .
This is illustrated by a recovery of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 immunoreactivity in the inner molecular layer and an increased vesicular glutamate transporter 1 immunolab@@ eling in the BR@@ 1 @-@ BR@@ 2 dendritic layers .
The afferent connections to the BR@@ 1 , a well @-@ defined bul@@ ge in the BR@@ 2 roof , were studied in the pigeon .
The results demonstrate a bilateral intrat@@ el@@ encephalic pathway arising from the BR@@ 1 in the BR@@ 2 .

ann@@ ularis , BR@@ 1 , and the avian homologue of the BR@@ 2 , n .
Most of the axons in the BR@@ 1 of adult cockroach BR@@ 2 derive from class I Ken@@ yon cells and are organized into regular , alternating pairs of pale and dark laminae .
The pattern of projections of peripheral receptors to the BR@@ 1 in the BR@@ 2 was mapped in rac@@ co@@ ons .
The purpose was to determine if the projection area of peripheral receptors to the fore@@ paw area in the BR@@ 1 region is dis@@ proportionally enlarged as it is in BR@@ 2 .
The fore@@ paw area in BR@@ 1 shows an enlargement comm@@ ensur@@ ate with that found in the BR@@ 2 .
This suggests that those factors that are selective for tactile acuity of the rac@@ co@@ on fore@@ paw were operating in the evolution of BR@@ 1 as they were in BR@@ 2 .
The somat@@ otopic organization of mechano@@ receptive projections to BR@@ 1 is reversed medi@@ ol@@ aterally compared to previous descriptions of this arrangement in other mammals : projections form axial structures lie medi@@ ally and those from apical structures lie laterally along the inferior bank of the BR@@ 2 in the rac@@ co@@ on .
Hor@@ seradish peroxidase , fluoresc@@ e@@ in- , or Texas red@@ - coupled dextran @-@ amine applied into the BR@@ 1 of larval lam@@ prey retrogradely labeled two populations of BR@@ 2 interneurons , one lateral and the other periventricular .
Trac@@ er application to the BR@@ 1 anter@@ ogr@@ ad@@ ely labeled thick contralateral fibers that specifically contact the BR@@ 2 by means of large boutons .
This BR@@ 1 -- BR@@ 2 inter@@ nuclear projection of lam@@ pre@@ ys appears to be similar to those involved in the coordination of horizontal eye movements in mammals .
The BR@@ 1 interneurons projected bilaterally to other BR@@ 2 .
Trac@@ er application to the BR@@ 1 labeled a group of small interneurons in the BR@@ 2 .
These data indicate that , in these deprived cats , there is little or no BR@@ 1 development for visual orienting , but BR@@ 2 is necessary for visual discrimination learning .
The distribution of these immunoreactive fibers in the BR@@ 1 is most consistent with an anteriorly directed efferent BR@@ 2 pathway .
Wheat germ agglutinin in a slow @-@ release polyacrylamide gel pellet was implanted in the BR@@ 1 or BR@@ 2 of the rat .
Large numbers of retrogradely labeled cells were visualized by immunocytochemical procedures in specific BR@@ 1 mainly ipsilateral to the implant site following implants as far caudal as the BR@@ 2 .
Total average number of labeled BR@@ 1 cells : BR@@ 2 , 2,@@ 115 ; cervical , 1,8@@ 78 ; lumbar , 1,0@@ 17 ; sacral , 385 .
Lab@@ eled cells were also seen in the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 .
Therefore , we interpret the paucity or absence of labeled cells in particular brain regions to indicate that cells of these regions do not project to the BR@@ 1 or BR@@ 2 .
These results suggest that the roles of L1 and TAG @-@ 1 in the formation of the comm@@ issures in the BR@@ 1 are different from their roles in the BR@@ 2 .
An@@ ter@@ ogr@@ ad@@ ely labeled fibers in the mam@@ ill@@ ot@@ eg@@ mental tract diverged from the principal mam@@ illary tract in an extensive dor@@ s@@ oc@@ aud@@ ally oriented sw@@ ath of axons which extended to the BR@@ 1 , and numerous axons turned sharply ventr@@ ally and rostr@@ ally to terminate top@@ ographically in the BR@@ 2 .
These findings indicate that neurons in the BR@@ 1 are reciproc@@ ally connected with BR@@ 2 projection neurons .
Expression of the genes Em@@ x1 , T@@ br@@ 1 , and E@@ omes in the BR@@ 1 of Xenopus laevis confirms the existence of a BR@@ 2 in all tetrap@@ ods .
We compared the expression patterns of these BR@@ 1 marker genes with that of the BR@@ 2 gene x@@ Distal @-@ less @-@ 4 .
Our results indicate that the whole BR@@ 1 of Xenopus expresses the T @-@ box genes Xenop@@ us@@ T@@ br@@ 1 and x@@ E@@ omes during embryonic and larval development , and the expression of these genes is top@@ ographically complementary to that of x@@ Distal @-@ less @-@ 4 in the BR@@ 2 .
On the other hand , during development x@@ Em@@ x1 is expressed in a large part of the BR@@ 1 except for an area adjacent to the BR@@ 2 , where x@@ Em@@ x1 is observed only in some mantle cells .
In contrast , the caudal part of the previously termed BR@@ 1 shows strong x@@ Em@@ x1 expression and may be a BR@@ 2 derivative .
Finally , expression of Xenop@@ us@@ T@@ br@@ 1 , x@@ E@@ omes , and x@@ Em@@ x1 is observed in the mitral cell layer of the BR@@ 1 from early developmental stages , further supporting that this structure is a BR@@ 2 derivative .
A total of 2,7@@ 36 wheat germ @-@ agglutin@@ ated horseradish peroxidase -@@ stained neurons were located within the BR@@ 1 , and a few labeled cells were consistently found bilaterally in the BR@@ 2 .
N@@ or was the BR@@ 1 injection site location related to the laminar distribution of BR@@ 2 projection neurons .
Antibodies against BR@@ 1 photoreceptor @-@ specific proteins reveal axonal projections from the phot@@ osensory BR@@ 2 in tele@@ osts .
Immun@@ oreactive cells with dend@@ rit@@ e- and axon@@ like processes were observed also in the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 .
Cortico@@ fu@@ gal projections to the BR@@ 1 in squirrel monkeys : further evidence of multiple BR@@ 2 vestibular fields .
while the other BR@@ 1 mentioned also have direct projections to the structures of the BR@@ 2 .
One hundred nine dendrites from six BR@@ 1 neurons and six BR@@ 2 neurons were examined .
The mean path distance was very similar for all dendrites in each group ( BR@@ 1 or BR@@ 2 ) regardless of the number of branches found along the path distance .
Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the patterns of BR@@ 1 input to neurons in the BR@@ 2 of the cat .
In the visual system of the cat the projection from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 has been studied extensively .
BR@@ 1 axons and BR@@ 2 neurons are labeled with horseradish peroxidase via injections into the optic tracts and optic radiations , respectively .
They are examined with the light microscope to identify labeled BR@@ 1 neurons that appear to be contacted by labeled BR@@ 2 axons .
This light microscopic analysis indicates that individual class 1 cells are contacted by many BR@@ 1 axons and that each of these axons contacts many BR@@ 2 neurons .
Thus , intrinsic BR@@ 1 neurons may represent peripherally displaced pteryg@@ opal@@ atine ganglion neurons forming a local network for regulation of vascular and non@@ vascular smooth muscle tone in the duck BR@@ 2 .
The morphologic and synaptic features of neurons in the rat BR@@ 1 were assessed using whole @-@ cell patch @-@ clamp recordings and bi@@ ocy@@ tin labeling in BR@@ 2 slices .
The BR@@ 1 has two foramin@@ a other than the BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 projections to the BR@@ 2 are less prominent than the projections from the lateral line .
BR@@ 1 and lateral line nerve efferen@@ ts arise from a common nucleus , the BR@@ 2 .
Ax@@ ons of efferent cells may divide to supply two or more branches of the BR@@ 1 and some axons supply both lateral line and BR@@ 2@@ e end@@ organs .
To further address the hypothesis that cholecystokinin in the BR@@ 1 arises from intrinsic or higher @-@ order neurons , cholecystokinin -8 @-@ specific radioimmunoassay and immunohistochemical experiments were carried out in adult rats after BR@@ 2 trac@@ t@@ otomy .
radioimmunoassay and immunohistochemical methods were also used to assess BR@@ 1 cholecystokinin concentrations in adult rats subjected to BR@@ 2 section at birth .
The BR@@ 1 contained significantly higher levels of cholecystokinin than the control BR@@ 2 .
To determine if the neonatal lesion @-@ induced increase in BR@@ 1 cholecystokinin is due to primary afferent or higher @-@ order reorganization , radioimmunoassay and immunohistochemical experiments were run after BR@@ 2 section at birth and trigeminal trac@@ t@@ otomy in adulthood .
In C6 it forms a dor@@ so@@ ventr@@ ally oriented narrow region at the lateral border of the BR@@ 1 ; in C7 and rostral C8 it forms a broad column in the BR@@ 2 .
Their axons invade the BR@@ 1 on fetal day 16 and run in the intermediate zone just below the BR@@ 2 , reaching the visual area of fetal day 18 .
In the transverse axis , neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase -positive cells seemed to follow a f@@ aint suprap@@ yramidal to inf@@ rap@@ yramidal gradient , which was due to differential timing of neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase -positive cells destin@@ ed for the BR@@ 1 of the suprap@@ yramidal and inf@@ rap@@ yramidal bl@@ ades of the BR@@ 2 .
Northern analysis of re@@ elin mRNA from normal rats showed that rat re@@ elin was expressed as a approximately 12 @-@ kb transcript in both the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 , whereas re@@ elin expression was markedly reduced in the shaking rat Kawasaki brains .
In situ hybridization analysis showed that re@@ elin mRNA in the shaking rat Kawasaki brains was expressed in Ca@@ j@@ al @-@ Ret@@ z@@ ius cells in the marginal zone of the BR@@ 1 and outer granular cells in the BR@@ 2 in similar man@@ ners to normal controls , but its expression was considerably reduced .
On Western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses using antibodies specific for the Re@@ elin protein , no immuno@@ product was recognized in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
Anatomy of the adrenergic system in the BR@@ 1 of the tree shre@@ w : PN@@ MT immunoreactive structures within the BR@@ 2 .
Two groups of adrenergic cells , which are equivalent to those of other species , were detected : Group C1 in the BR@@ 1 and group C2 in the BR@@ 2 .
In group C2 , some immunoreactive cell bodies smaller than those in C1 and many nerve terminals are found in the BR@@ 1 , but most of the adrenergic cells and fibers are observed in the BR@@ 2 .
Our data give new information about the adrenergic system in the BR@@ 1 , especially in the BR@@ 2 of the tree shre@@ w , a species that provides a useful model of a small primate brain .
Patterns of projection from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 is a major source of auditory projections to the BR@@ 2 .
Although the projections from the BR@@ 1 have been well characterized , projections from the surrounding BR@@ 2 have received relatively little attention .
The BR@@ 1 project bilaterally , and the BR@@ 2 projects ipsi@@ laterally .
The remaining BR@@ 1 project only ipsi@@ laterally or contain separate populations of cells that project to the two BR@@ 2 .
Morphology of neuropeptide Y @-@ immunoreactive neurons in the cat BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 : postnatal development and species comparison .
The distribution and morphology of Neuro@@ peptide Y @-@ immunoreactive neurons in the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 was studied in the adult cat and rat , and the common marmos@@ et Cal@@ lith@@ rix j@@ acch@@ us .
In all three species , the population of Neuro@@ peptide Y @-@ immunoreactive neurons is localized in the white matter extending from the BR@@ 1 to the border of the BR@@ 2 .
The former , ipsilateral projection termin@@ ates in the granule cell layer of the BR@@ 1 and in layer II / III of the BR@@ 2 .
Reconstruction of the latter projection has revealed that the fibers are continuous with the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 suggesting a commissural contralateral projection .
Later in development the fiber density in the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 becomes considerably reduced .
In contrast , the plexus density in the BR@@ 1 and the granule cell layer of the BR@@ 2 undergoes only a slight reduction , and the Neuro@@ peptide Y @-@ immunoreactive cell number remains roughly constant .
We found that novel projections from the intact BR@@ 1 to BR@@ 2 emerge after lesions performed as late as postnatal day 25 .
Fol@@ iation patterns correlate with the expansion of the BR@@ 1 layers and of total BR@@ 2 .
Top@@ ographical organization of projections from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 in the rat .
The projections from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 were comprehensively examined in the rat by using the anterograde Phaseolus vulgaris leuc@@ o@@ agglutinin and retrograde cholera toxin B subunit methods .
Furthermore , the temporal @-@ to @-@ septal axis of origin in the BR@@ 1 corresponded to a ventrolateral @-@ to @-@ dorsomedial axis of termination in the BR@@ 2 .
These results suggest that different populations of neurons existing along the longitudinal axis of the BR@@ 1 may exert their influences on the execution of different BR@@ 2 functions .
The BR@@ 1 also appear to project to the BR@@ 2 .
Generation and death of cells in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 of the w@@ all@@ ab@@ y , Set@@ on@@ ix brachy@@ urus .
Neurons in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 were generated at P1 @-@ P@@ 10 and P1 @-@ P@@ 18 respectively .
Peak numbers of labelled cells were seen at P3 and P5 in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
Cell death was assessed in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 of young aged P@@ 10 @-@ P@@ 150 .
With further development , the BR@@ 1 was not re@@ established ; newly developing neuro@@ epithelium in the BR@@ 2 , however , generated an intact basal lamina .
The present data demonstrate that the BR@@ 1 , by anchoring the neuro@@ epithelial cells to the pial surface of the BR@@ 2 , has an important function in the development of the normal cyto@@ architecture of this structure .
We have investigated the target dependence of BR@@ 1 motor neurons in postnatal rats by trans@@ ecting the BR@@ 2 and preventing reinnervation of the tongue .
Moreover , many of the dendrites in this BR@@ 1 region express both N @-@ methyl @-@ D @-@ aspartate and serotonin 2A receptors , and some of these dendrites may arise from the adjacent BR@@ 2 .
The neuro@@ genetic gradients of neurons showing glutamic acid decarboxylase immunoreactivity were determined in the BR@@ 1 of the mouse BR@@ 2 .
Radial gradients of neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase -positive cells are characterized by two main features : 1 ) with the exception of the BR@@ 1 and its interface with the BR@@ 2 , glutamic acid decarboxylase -positive neurons of the plexiform strata are generated before those destin@@ ed for the pyramidal layer ; 2 ) within the pyramidal layer , glutamic acid decarboxylase -positive cells are positioned according to an inside @-@ out sequence .
Given the selective laminar disposition of the GABAergic interneurons in the BR@@ 1 , the present authors explored whether or not the diverse types of these interneurons could have specific birth dates and concluded that no relationship exists between birth dates and adult phenotypes of glutamic acid decarboxylase -@@ immunoreactive cells in the mouse BR@@ 2 .
We examined in rats the relationship between the ordering of BR@@ 1 axons in the optic pathway and the formation of a retin@@ ot@@ opically organized projection to their primary target , the BR@@ 2 .
We have previously found that axons labeled by focal injections of 1,1 &apos; -di@@ octadec@@ yl 3,@@ 3,3 &apos; , 3 &apos; -@@ tetramethyl@@ in@@ doc@@ arb@@ ocyanine perchlorate made in BR@@ 1 of perinatal rats commonly mist@@ arg@@ et along the medial @-@ lateral and rostral @-@ caudal axes of the BR@@ 2 .
In the present study , we made similar 1,1 &apos; -di@@ octadec@@ yl 3,@@ 3,3 &apos; , 3 &apos; -@@ tetramethyl@@ in@@ doc@@ arb@@ ocyanine perchlorate injections , covering less than 2 % of the BR@@ 1 , in BR@@ 2 , in rats of two age groups , embryonic day 21 to P 2 and P@@ 11 @-@ P@@ 17 .
In BR@@ 1 , labeled axons travel in fasc@@ icles directly from the injection site to the BR@@ 2 , but neighbor relationships begin to degrade as fasc@@ icles split and mix .
Retin@@ otopic order is virtually lost in the BR@@ 1 ; axons labeled from each injection site disperse throughout its cross @-@ sectional area , but the labeled axons tend to be concentrated toward a specific half of the nerve depending upon their BR@@ 2 origin .
However , the distributions of labeled BR@@ 1 axons observed in whole moun@@ ts of the BR@@ 2 and optic pathway have a degree of disorder similar to those in E@@ 21 @-@ P2 rats .
The localization of non @-@ N @-@ methyl @-@ D @-@ aspartate glutamate receptor subunits to neurons throughout the macaque BR@@ 1 provides further evidence for the glutamatergic regulation of neuroendocrine , autonomic , and BR@@ 2 circuits .
Other fibers ran through the BR@@ 1 en route to the BR@@ 2 .
We used steroid autoradiography to measure the ontogeny of steroid accumulation in the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 , two motoneur@@ onal groups thought to differ in their sensitivity to androgens .
BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 motoneurons differ in the ontogeny of androgen accumulation .
The BR@@ 1 projects to more lateral parts of these lobules with the exception of BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 projects to BR@@ 2 and to the hemisphere .
The other projections of the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 to the hemisphere are similar to those reported for the cat .
An accessory cell group in the sheep , located between the BR@@ 1 , has connections with the BR@@ 2 and the hemisphere .
nucleotidase in the rodent BR@@ 1 : relation to the distribution of le@@ u @-@ enkephalin , cell clusters , and BR@@ 2 innervation .
The goal of this study was to determine the compartmental organization of 5 &apos; -nucleotidase within the rodent BR@@ 1 and to compare the distribution of 5 &apos; -nucleotidase with that of le@@ u @-@ enkephalin , cell clusters , and BR@@ 2 innervation .
This &quot; medial band &quot; extends from the rostral pole of the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 .
The innervation of the BR@@ 1 by the BR@@ 2 is den@@ ser in the shell than in the core .
Overall , the compartmental structure of 5 &apos; -nucleotidase in the BR@@ 1 segreg@@ ates projections from different layers of the BR@@ 2 .
Application of wheat germ agglutinin horseradish peroxidase to the BR@@ 1 and adjacent areas of the BR@@ 2 labeled numerous neurons in each of the left and right superior cervical ganglia .
Also , the BR@@ 1 was divided into BR@@ 2 , and the volume and number of single @-@ stranded DNA -@@ immunoreactive cells in each part were measured on PD@@ 6 , 8 , 11 , 16 , and 31 .
There was no sex difference in volume or number of apoptotic cells in the BR@@ 1 or BR@@ 2 .
If all L and LD cells are formed at the BR@@ 1 margin and first develop oriented dendrites , we have to assume that the more randomly oriented dendritic trees in the BR@@ 2 have undergone a reorganization .
To find out whether a zonal pattern exists in the BR@@ 1 , a topological analysis was made of the Purkinje cell layer of a Niss@@ l @-@ stained series of the BR@@ 2 .
In the experimental part of this study , the cor@@ ti@@ con@@ uclear projections to the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 were demonstrated with the horseradish peroxidase technique .
Two strips of Purkinje cells remained unlabeled : One in the BR@@ 1 , and another in the BR@@ 2 .
After horseradish peroxidase gel impl@@ antations in the BR@@ 1 aimed at the BR@@ 2 , respectively .
It can be concluded that BR@@ 1 as demonstrated in the turtle P@@ se@@ u@@ de@@ my@@ s scrip@@ ta elegans , are phylogenetically very old and may represent the basic functional circuit of the BR@@ 2 .
In neonatal rats the unilateral transection of the BR@@ 1 causes a fast and complete degeneration of the BR@@ 2 .
Although its specificity was not totally maintained , the medi@@ olateral distribution of spro@@ uted afferents in the BR@@ 1 matched the caud@@ oro@@ str@@ al disposition of parent neurons in the BR@@ 2 , as in the case in normal oliv@@ oc@@ erebellar projection .
An@@ ter@@ ograde studies showed that compensatory fibers rec@@ ros@@ sing the BR@@ 1 midline spread throughout the whole extent of the deprived BR@@ 2 and terminate solely in the molecular layer as typical climbing fibers .
Peptide @-@ like immunoreactivity was observed in axons within the BR@@ 1 stump BR@@ 2 to the crush , as in previous studies .
The BR@@ 1 contralateral to the procedure displayed only occasional isolated peptide @-@ containing fibers , as in normal BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 ipsilateral and contralateral to the crush exhibited no change in the normal pattern of peptide @-@ like immunoreactivity , including the absence of demonstrable peptide @-@ like immunoreactivity in the somata of BR@@ 2 ganglion cells .
The patterns of leucine enkephalin - , CC@@ K@@ 8- , and bombesin -like immunore@@ activities in the BR@@ 1 were identical to those following irreversible BR@@ 2 deafferen@@ tation as long as 9 months postoperatively .
The BR@@ 1 are the BR@@ 2 in the insect brain .
To assign the input @-@ output connectivity of all glomeruli , we investigated the spatial relationship of the anten@@ nal tracts and two prominent BR@@ 1 output tracts ( BR@@ 2 ) mainly formed by un@@ ig@@ lomerular projection neurons using fluorescent tracing , confocal microscopy , and 3D analyses .
The results revealed a clear segregation of glomeruli into two BR@@ 1 specifically supplied by projection neurons of the BR@@ 2 .
Trac@@ ing of three medi@@ olateral anten@@ no @-@ cerebral tracts mainly formed by multi@@ glomerular projection neurons revealed terminals in distinct compartments of the BR@@ 1 and in three BR@@ 2 .
Colum@@ ns of 30 @-@ 50 microns in diameter are hypothesized to be a general feature of BR@@ 1 organization , but no quantitative analysis of different human BR@@ 2 has been performed .
These zones vary in relative thickness around the circumference of the BR@@ 1 ; the deep zone is proportionally thicker in the most BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 and its projection to the BR@@ 2 .
The results show that very few , if any , BR@@ 1 neurons project to more than one area of BR@@ 2 .
Rather , the BR@@ 1 is defined by multiple specific relationships with the BR@@ 2 .
Cor@@ tic@@ ospinal axons are first present in the BR@@ 1 at day 5 and in the BR@@ 2 by day 9 .
Direct projections from the BR@@ 1 to BR@@ 2 preganglionic parasympathetic neurons : a link to cerebrovascular regulation .
Therefore , we sought to test the hypothesis that the BR@@ 1 , the site of termination of arterial baroreceptor nerves , projects to BR@@ 2 preganglionic neurons whose stimulation elicits cerebral vasodilatation .
The study establishes the presence of a direct mon@@ osynaptic pathway from neurons in the BR@@ 1 to BR@@ 2 preganglionic parasympathetic neurons that project to the pteryg@@ opal@@ atine ganglia , the source of nitro@@ x@@ id@@ ergic vasodilatory innervation of cerebral blood vessels .
Finally , quantitative in situ hybridization showed that K@@ v 1.4 mRNA was significantly upregulated in BR@@ 1 , but not gray matter , after BR@@ 2 injury .
In summary , we show that K@@ v 1.4 is expressed in glial cells and not in axons in the rat BR@@ 1 and that its expression is markedly increased in cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage after chronic BR@@ 2 injury .
To determine whether an equivalent adrenergic population is present in the BR@@ 1 of the cat , we used antibodies raised against bovine adrenal pheny@@ lethanolamine @-@ N @-@ methyltransferase to map the distribution of adrenaline @-@ synthesizing neurons in the BR@@ 2 .
The majority of labeled cells were seen in a nucleus designated BR@@ 1 at the level of the BR@@ 2 .
Our results are consistent with the notion that an area of the BR@@ 1 containing adrenergic perikarya is the anatomical structure responsible for cardiovascular changes that occur when chemicals are applied to BR@@ 2 .
Previous work from our laboratory and others , examining synapses between neurons in the BR@@ 1 and neurons in the BR@@ 2 revealed ultrastructural characteristics that have been implicated in the expression of synaptic plasticity at other locations in the brain .
SMN , the product of the BR@@ 1 muscular atrophy @-@ determining gene , is expressed widely but selectively in the developing human BR@@ 2 .
Mutations in the survival motor neuron gene cause BR@@ 1 muscular atrophy , an autosomal recessive disease characterized by degeneration of lower motor neurons in the BR@@ 2 leading to progressive muscle wasting .
At this caudal level , it reaches its maximal elongation and extends from the ventral tip of the BR@@ 1 to the dorsolateral aspects of the BR@@ 2 .
Staining also appeared at specific stages in the BR@@ 1 , the BR@@ 2 , and the skin .
neuropeptide Y -@@ neurons are generated between E@@ 14 and E@@ 20 and are found in layers II @-@ VI of the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 .
The projection to BR@@ 1 shared relatively limited zones of origin with the projections directed to BR@@ 2 .
Distribution of catecholaminergic neuronal systems in the canine BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 neurons of the BR@@ 2 were much more scattered than in rats or rabbits , but relatively similar to cats .
An ascending catecholaminergic fiber pathway was traced through the central tegmental field of the canine BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 , with features similar to the primate .
Responses to electrical stimulation of the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 were characterized and selected neurons were injected with horseradish peroxidase .
Neurons anti@@ dro@@ mically activated by BR@@ 1 stimulation were generally mon@@ osyn@@ ap@@ tically excited by the BR@@ 2 .
Not@@ able was the absence of strong BR@@ 1 inhibition by stimulation of the BR@@ 2 .
Light microscopy of anti@@ dro@@ mically identified injected cells demonstrated that these cells are predominantly located at the central levels of the BR@@ 1 along the incoming BR@@ 2 fibers but a few are found at more caudal levels .
In the avian auditory system , the neural network for computing the localization of sound in space begins with bilateral innervation of BR@@ 1 by BR@@ 2 neurons .
We used antibodies against the neural specific markers Hu C / D , neurofilament , and SV@@ 2 together with retrograde fluorescent dextran labeling from the BR@@ 1 to identify BR@@ 2 neurons within the an@@ l@@ age and follow their development .
By observing the pattern of neuronal rearrangements together with the pattern of contral@@ aterally projecting BR@@ 1 fibers , we could identify BR@@ 2 in the ventral an@@ l@@ age .
Thus , extensive path@@ finding and morphological rearrangement of BR@@ 1 occurs well before the arrival of BR@@ 2 afferents .
In the first stage , each germinal cell becoming a ganglion cell extends an axon into the fibre layer of the BR@@ 1 and towards the BR@@ 2 , and the soma of the cell moves towards the ganglion cell layer .
The emergence of the B16 protein was also examined in BR@@ 1 from mice homozygous for the BR@@ 2 degeneration mutation which affects photoreceptor synapt@@ ogenesis .
Application of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B in the BR@@ 1 resulted in uptake in ependymal axons and back@@ filling of perikarya in the dorsome@@ dian part of the BR@@ 2 , immediately under the caudal aqueduc@@ t .
s neither in the BR@@ 1 nor in the BR@@ 2 .
However , on embryonic day 17 we consistently found retrogradely labeled cells in the BR@@ 1 , indicating that the development of the BR@@ 2 projection precedes that of the sep@@ to@@ hippocampal projection .
A comparative analysis of individual growth cones found in the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 revealed no striking differences in their morphology .
Electron microscopic analysis showed that growth cones in the BR@@ 1 were mainly contacted by other axons , whereas growth cones in the BR@@ 2 had contact with all available elements .
G@@ radi@@ ents between nasal and temporal areas of the cat BR@@ 1 in the properties of BR@@ 2 ganglion cells .
A difference matrix , formed by sub@@ trac@@ ting the metabolic activity matrix of BR@@ 1 contralateral to the stimulated eye from the ipsilateral &quot; depressed &quot; matrix , emphasized those parts of the BR@@ 2 that received monocular visual input .
In BR@@ 1 , differences were maximal in the medial monocular portion , and the lateral or binocular portion was shown to be divided metabolically into a far lateral contral@@ aterally dominant strip along the BR@@ 2 representation of the vertical meri@@ dian , and a more medial region of patches of more or less contral@@ aterally dominant binocular input .
BR@@ 1 differences were less than those of BR@@ 2 , and regions of greater and lesser monocular input could be distinguished .
We did not detect differences between the two hemispheres in either anterior or BR@@ 1 , thus indicating either completely binocular input , or a greater dependence than in the BR@@ 2 on inputs that were not affected by the visual manipulations .
Their total number was estimated to be 42.5 + / - 11.7 in the entire BR@@ 1 on one side of the BR@@ 2 , but this may have been an underestimation , as the penetration by the antisera was limited .
More neurons in the medial than the lateral half , and more in the caudal than the rostral half of the BR@@ 1 project to the BR@@ 2 .
In general , best elevations for afferents corresponded to hair cell orientations in the region innervated ; unexpectedly low elevations obtained from afferents innervating the BR@@ 1 may reflect curvature of the sensory epithelium against the BR@@ 2 .
Variation in terminal field sites also was noted in the medial to lateral axis of the BR@@ 1 ; however , there were no consistent correlations between terminal field locations , physiology , and best directions of the BR@@ 2 afferents .
In BR@@ 1 of cats substance P fibers and terminals are present along its ventral and lateral border , a par@@ al@@ amin@@ ar area in which BR@@ 2 fibers have been shown to terminate and where neurons responsive to noxious stimuli have been reported .
Also in rats the substance P innervation of BR@@ 1 is similar to that of BR@@ 2 tract fibers .
The presence of substance P -positive BR@@ 1 neurons in the BR@@ 2 is reported in the following paper .
The development of cyto@@ architectural features of the BR@@ 1 was examined in rat to identify age @-@ related patterns of growth in major BR@@ 2 compartments that have been described previously ( Cl@@ er@@ ic@@ i and Col@@ eman &#91; 1990 &#93; J. Com@@ p .
Golgi stains after birth reveal restricted dendritic arbor@@ izations in BR@@ 1 cells and dichotomous branching patterns of BR@@ 2 neurons .
S@@ omal growth occurs between all postnatal age groups tested for BR@@ 1 , although BR@@ 2 related to high and low frequencies do not differ .
Retrograde and trans@@ ganglionic transport of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to the B @-@ fragment of cholera toxin was used to study the location , morphology , and central projections of BR@@ 1 ( BR@@ 2 ) neurons innervating rat masticatory muscles .
Extensive central projections from labeled BR@@ 1 cells could be seen extending from the BR@@ 2 rostr@@ ally to the C2 segment caud@@ ally .
Despite the relatively un@@ featured cyto@@ architecture of the BR@@ 1 , this large BR@@ 2 has been found to have a modular macroscopic sub@@ structure comprising the neuro@@ chemically distinct stri@@ osomes and matrix , and , within the matrix , patchy input and output arrangements called mat@@ ris@@ omes .
We injected medium spiny neurons in lightly fixed slices of the squirrel monkey BR@@ 1 , reconstructed their dendritic arb@@ ors , and analyzed the orientations of these arb@@ ors with respect to the cardinal planes of the BR@@ 2 .
We obtained comparable supplementary observations for the ferret BR@@ 1 , suggesting that such spatial alignment of spiny dendritic arb@@ ors may be a general feature of BR@@ 2 organization .
The distribution of radiolabeled neurons in the BR@@ 1 of Lam@@ pe@@ tra flu@@ vi@@ ati@@ l@@ is was studied following unilateral injections of D @-@ aspartate in the BR@@ 2 .
After survival periods of 1 @-@ 3 days , labeled perikarya were present within and nearby the BR@@ 1 and in the BR@@ 2 .
In control Wistar rats , BR@@ 1 adenylate cyclase @-@ activating polypeptide immunoreactivity was expressed in fibers in the BR@@ 2 at all segmental levels examined .
After chronic , cyclophosphamide -induced cystitis , BR@@ 1 adenylate cyclase @-@ activating polypeptide immunoreactivity increased dramatically in BR@@ 2 and dorsal root ganglia involved in micturition reflexes .
The density of BR@@ 1 adenylate cyclase @-@ activating polypeptide immunoreactivity was increased in the superficial laminae of the L1 , L2 , L6 , and S1 BR@@ 2 .
In the squirrel , guinea pig , and hamster , mu and kappa binding is dense in the BR@@ 1 and the molecular layer of the BR@@ 2 .
In the other species , the delta binding pattern is generally the inverse of the mu / kappa pattern : most areas of the BR@@ 1 are enriched in delta sites , whereas the BR@@ 2 and the pyramidal cell layer are receptor @-@ sparse .
While glucagon @-@ immunoreactive amacrine cells were negative for substance P in BR@@ 1 , a subset of this type of amacrine cell was immunoreactive for substance P in far BR@@ 2 .
The projection of BR@@ 1 neurons to the BR@@ 2 was studied to pigmented rats by means of the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase .
The main focus of labeled neurons following BR@@ 1 injections of horseradish peroxidase was located in the BR@@ 2 , at rostral levels .
This pattern of labeling contrasts with that in cases of BR@@ 1 injections , in which the main focus of labeled somata occupied more BR@@ 2 .
Combining the latter finding with the prec@@ e@@ eding notion regarding BR@@ 1 divergence suggests a mechanism by which sensorimotor information might be transmitted to several different BR@@ 2 locations .
In addition , motor axons formed terminals in BR@@ 1 layer V only or in layers I , III , and V. By contrast , the somatosensory axon formed a single plexus of terminals in layer IV of the BR@@ 2 that extended approximately 0.3 mm ro@@ stro@@ caudal and 0.4 mm medi@@ olateral .
Synap@@ ses from BR@@ 1 branches in the BR@@ 2 .
With light and electron microscopy , using mice , we studied the central branches of BR@@ 1 neurons that are given off to the BR@@ 2 .
These results indicate that the BR@@ 1 is an integrating center for vestibular , auditory , and other types of information , but the results do not fit with current theories about the function of the BR@@ 2 .
Group A monkeys had horseradish peroxidase injections or transc@@ annular horseradish peroxidase gel implants into the BR@@ 1 , the largest of which involved adjacent BR@@ 2 ( e.@@ g .
Group B monkeys had injections / implants into the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 , BR@@ 2 , and cell group Y , on the other hand , contained almost no labeling .
These cases contained the largest numbers of labeled cells in the BR@@ 1 and a lesser number in the BR@@ 2 .
The so @-@ called BR@@ 1 also innerv@@ ates the BR@@ 2 .
Pro@@ jec@@ tions from BR@@ 1 terminated in BR@@ 2 without a clear topography .
We observed that RL terminals are largest , F terminals are intermediate in size , and RS ( BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 ) terminals are smallest .
BR@@ 1 : are@@ al , laminar , and tangential distribution of afferents and efferen@@ ts in the BR@@ 2 of rhesus monkeys .
The terminal distribution of BR@@ 1 afferents in primate BR@@ 2 has never been examined in any detail .
As expected on the basis of retrograde degeneration and transport studies , injections centered in the BR@@ 1 labeled cells and terminals in the BR@@ 2 .
No terminal label was ever observed in layers I , II , superficial III , V , or VI in any part of the BR@@ 1 following injections confined to any part of BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 projections to BR@@ 2 in the rat .
A previous study in the rat revealed that distinct BR@@ 1 areas projected to specific columns of the midbrain BR@@ 2 .
This study used anterograde tracing techniques to define projections to the BR@@ 1 arising from the same BR@@ 2 regions .
There were also projections to BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
The efferent axons of the BR@@ 1 neurons are already present and already highly organized in the BR@@ 2 of newborn rats .
Most of the autoradiographic labelling subsequent to the injection of 3H @-@ leucine into the BR@@ 1 is seen in the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 , ventral and dorsal lamellae , supplies climbing fiber inputs to the BR@@ 2 .
V@@ Glu@@ T2 immunoreactivity was widely distributed in the BR@@ 1 , particularly in the BR@@ 2 , from postnatal day 0 to adulthood , suggesting relatively early maturation of V@@ Glu@@ T2 @-@ loaded glutamatergic axons .
Interestingly , Vesi@@ cular glutamate transporter 1 immunoreactivity was frequently colocalized with V@@ Glu@@ T2 immunoreactivity at single axon terminal @-@ like profiles in layer IV of the BR@@ 1 from P5 to P@@ 10 and in the BR@@ 2 from postnatal day 0 to P@@ 14 .
The present results indicate that V@@ Glu@@ T2 @-@ loaded glutamatergic axons mat@@ urate earlier than Vesi@@ cular glutamate transporter 1 -@@ laden axons in the mouse BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 , and suggest that Vesi@@ cular glutamate transporter 1 plays a transient developmental role in some glutamatergic systems that mainly use V@@ Glu@@ T2 in the adulthood .
By immunohistochemistry , both forms of the receptor were found to be predominantly expressed in BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 , in keeping with earlier radioligand binding and in situ hybridization data .
Gangli@@ osides were extracted , separated by thin layer chromatography , and quantitated in three BR@@ 1 of the gar@@ fish : the completely unmyelinated BR@@ 2 , and two nerves composed of both myelinated and unmyelinated fibers , viz .
These results indicate that the BR@@ 1 is capable of substantial reorganization , which may account for much of the reorganization seen in BR@@ 2 .
We report here that : 1 ) BR@@ 1 neurons excited chiefly by noxious stimulation of the face have their dendritic tree located primarily within the field of lamina I BR@@ 2 projections , i.@@ e .
in BR@@ 1 mid @-@ extent , around the borderline between the external lateral and both the lateral cresc@@ ent and the BR@@ 2 .
Our results suggest the presence of an extensive excitatory ax@@ odend@@ ritic link between lamina I projections and BR@@ 1 nociceptive neurons around the lateral cresc@@ ent and the BR@@ 2 .
Distribution of brain @-@ derived neurotrophic factor and TrkB receptor proteins in the fetal and postnatal BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 of the guinea pig .
This study investigates the distribution of brain @-@ derived neurotrophic factor protein and its receptor , TrkB , during the development of BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 in a long @-@ gestation species , the guinea pig .
With advancing gestational age an increase in the intensity of brain @-@ derived neurotrophic factor protein -@@ IR in granule cells was accompanied by concomitant increases in the staining and are@@ al growth of the associated mossy fiber layer in the BR@@ 1 , and the molecular layer in the BR@@ 2 .
Thus , we have demonstrated in both the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 that the spatiotemporal distribution of brain @-@ derived neurotrophic factor protein -@@ IR and TrkB @-@ IR coincides with the maturation of granule cells prenatally and with significant periods of neuropil growth , both prenatally and in the immediate postnatal period .
The thalam@@ o @-@ cortical projections are as follows : The BR@@ 1 receives a projection from BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 receives projections from BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 receives a projection from BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 receives a projection from BR@@ 2 .
The course of axons of BR@@ 1 ganglion cells within the BR@@ 2@@ e and tract of the chick .
In the proximal part of the BR@@ 1 , radial BR@@ 2 lesions resulted in a sheet of degenerating axons along the ro@@ stro@@ caudal extent of the nerve .
In the BR@@ 1 , the distribution of fibers was similar to that seen in the proximal part of the BR@@ 2 .
The ventral , nasal and temporal BR@@ 1 fibers lay in the superficial part of the tract whereas the fibers from the BR@@ 2 ran in the deeper , medial aspect of the tract .
As the tract approached the BR@@ 1 degenerating fibers from single BR@@ 2 lesions did not always remain together .
In the case of a lesion in the BR@@ 1 , degenerating fibers split into two bundles located at opposite ends of the tract only to re@@ un@@ ite at their terminal regional at the caudal pole of the BR@@ 2 .
Neurons of predominantly medium size in the BR@@ 1 gave rise to reticul@@ ore@@ ticular fibers descending directly to and distributed bilaterally in the BR@@ 2 .
The organisation of the BR@@ 1 ( BR@@ 2 ) in marmos@@ et monkeys was studied by means of extracellular recordings of responses to visual stimulation and examination of myel@@ in- and cytochrome oxidase @-@ stained sections .
The total surface area of BR@@ 1 is approximately 100 mm2 , or about 50 % of the surface area of BR@@ 2 in the same individuals .
Although fibers immunoreactive for calcitonin gene @-@ related peptide were identified in low density throughout the BR@@ 1 , only female rats displayed prominent fiber staining in the BR@@ 2 .
Double @-@ labelling immunofluorescence experiments revealed that the calcitonin gene @-@ related peptide -@@ immunoreactive cells within the BR@@ 1 , but not the BR@@ 2 , were also immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase ; at least 60 % of the A@@ 13 dopaminergic neurons co @-@ express calcitonin gene @-@ related peptide .
Desc@@ ending projections from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 in the gerbil , M@@ eri@@ ones un@@ gu@@ icul@@ atus .
These projections target the BR@@ 1 ipsi@@ laterally and the BR@@ 2 bilaterally , with the ipsilateral component predominant .
The BR@@ 1 targets midbrain BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 projection originates from smaller layer V pyr@@ am@@ ids and targets the BR@@ 2 cortices with dense terminal fields .
Ethanol exposure had no effect on neuronal size or choline acetyltransferase staining intensity of BR@@ 1 or BR@@ 2 neurons when compared to chow @-@ fed offspring .
Func@@ tionally distinct subdivisions of the BR@@ 1 in the BR@@ 2 of the male sph@@ in@@ x moth Man@@ duc@@ a sex@@ ta .
Each BR@@ 1 in the brain of a male moth has a distinctive neuropil structure , the BR@@ 2 , which is specialized for primary processing of information about the conspecific female sex @-@ pheromone blend .
Dendritic field sizes increase from 150 microm in the BR@@ 1 to 300 microm in the BR@@ 2 periphery .
In rats of these three age groups , labelled neurons were found bilaterally in the BR@@ 1 , with a contralateral predominance , and they were found in both the BR@@ 2 .
Systematic char@@ ting also revealed smaller numbers of estrogen @-@ concentrating cells in other specific BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 locations .
BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 were virtually un@@ labelled .
In order to examine whether this limit was imposed by optic fibers or by target cells , optic synapses were counted in surgically hal@@ ved BR@@ 1 which received compressed optic projections consisting of regenerating optic fibers from the BR@@ 2 .
Localization of enkephal@@ inergic neurons in the BR@@ 1 projecting to the BR@@ 2 of the cat .
The BR@@ 1 of the cat is known to contain enkephal@@ inergic neurons , with most of the enkephalin co @-@ contained in the catecholaminergic neurons ; however , enkephal@@ inergic cells projecting to the BR@@ 2 have not been identified .
A high concentration of these neurons was evident in the BR@@ 1 when compared to the BR@@ 2 ( P less than .
Both the enkephal@@ inergic and catecholaminergic neurons projecting to the BR@@ 1 were located in the same general areas of the BR@@ 2 and there was no significant difference in the mean diameters of these two neuronal types ( P greater than .
The immunoreactivity for each marker was compared with the distribution of superimposed autoradiographic labeling of BR@@ 1 afferents after unilateral injection of 3H @-@ amino acids into the BR@@ 2@@ t .
We conclude that in the rat BR@@ 1 , S@@ PL@@ I and N@@ TL@@ I are contained within two distinct populations of afferents which may originate from perikarya in the BR@@ 2 , whereas enkephal@@ in@@ like immunoreactivity and the catecholamines are more likely to be found in other afferents or possibly in intrinsic neurons .
Morphology of neuro@@ glia in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 of the brain of the honey@@ bee .
We investigated the distribution and anatomical organization of glial cells in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 of the honey@@ bee .
There are glial cells of different shape in the soma r@@ ind which are wrapped around the neuronal cell bodies of the BR@@ 1 and the Ken@@ yon cells of the BR@@ 2 .
A layer of glial cells separates the BR@@ 1 neurop@@ ile from the surrounding BR@@ 2 neurop@@ ile .
There is a high density of astrocyte @-@ like glia in a column of the BR@@ 1 which can be followed to the BR@@ 2 .
A network of BR@@ 1 intrinsic glial cells separates the alpha @-@ lobe from the beta @-@ lobe and the BR@@ 2 .
The density of these axons reached levels that were higher than in any other part of the BR@@ 1 except for the BR@@ 2 .
The highest level of choline acetyltransferase -@@ immunopositive profiles was seen in the BR@@ 1 and the second highest in the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 displayed a relatively low density of cholinergic innervation , and there were only rare choline acetyltransferase -positive fibers in the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 displayed the most severe loss of choline acetyltransferase -positive profiles , whereas the BR@@ 2 displayed relatively little change .

Finally , measurement of the cell diameters of neurons within the densely labeled areas in relay layers revealed that labeled and unlabeled neurons could not be distinguished on the basis of cell body size alone and that some of the smallest cells of the BR@@ 1 project to BR@@ 2 .
The type I terminals accounted for more than 70 % of the total population of glutamate @-@ enriched boutons in contact with dopaminergic cells in the dorsal and ventral ti@@ ers of the BR@@ 1 as well as in the BR@@ 2 , whereas 5 @-@ 20 % of the glutamatergic synapses with dopaminergic neurons involved the two other types of terminals .
Un@@ crossed and crossed projections from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 in the rat , studied by anterograde axonal tracing .
Un@@ crossed and crossed projections were distinguished by BR@@ 1 lesions placed on the side contralateral or ipsilateral to the tracer injections confined to the BR@@ 2 .
In the BR@@ 1 , terminals were seen in the middle of the medi@@ olateral extent , whereas , in the BR@@ 2 , they were seen in lateral and caudal parts .
The terminals of crossed projections from the BR@@ 1 were distributed ventr@@ ally in BR@@ 2 .
In the BR@@ 1 , labeled terminals were seen mainly in ro@@ stro@@ medial parts , whereas , in the BR@@ 2 , they were seen in caudal and dorsal parts of the medial half .
The present study suggests that the medial lamina VI group and the BR@@ 1 in the upper cervical segments project to the different areas of the BR@@ 2 and are concerned with different functions .
In the present study we examined the synapt@@ ology of the axon initial segments of three populations of retrogradely labeled pyramidal cells : BR@@ 1 , cortico@@ thalamic , and BR@@ 2 projecting cells .
Our results show that each population of efferent cells examined received a characteristic and rather homogeneous number of ax@@ o@@ ax@@ onic synapses : 16 to 23 for axon initial segments of BR@@ 1 cells , 22 to 28 for BR@@ 2 cells , and 1 to 5 for cortico@@ thalamic cells .
Within grafts of BR@@ 1 tissue located in the BR@@ 2 tyrosine hydroxylase -positive neurons were distributed evenly at short times postim@@ plantation .
On the other hand , no compart@@ mentation and reinnervation of surrounding host tissue was observed for intra@@ hypothalamic grafts of BR@@ 1 tissue or intra@@ striatal grafts of BR@@ 2 tissue .
Western blotting of the nucleus , cytoplasm , and membrane subcellular fractions of the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 tissues demonstrated that all three fractions contained N@@ ogo @-@ A. N@@ ogo @-@ A immunoreactivity could be identified under confocal microscope in the nucleus , peri@@ k@@ ay@@ on , and proximal dendrite and along the cell membrane .
The thin lamina between the BR@@ 1 and granule cell layer , or sub@@ granule zone , is an area of active proliferation within the adult BR@@ 2 known to generate new neurons throughout adult life .

Aff@@ eren@@ t projections to the BR@@ 1 are organized along both the ro@@ stro@@ caudal axis and the ventrolateral to dorsomedial margin of the BR@@ 2 .
An inverted but discontinuous facial representation exists through the re@@ stro@@ caudal axis of the BR@@ 1 with peri@@ oral and nasal receptive fields innervated by the infr@@ atro@@ chle@@ ar nerves represented rostral to the progressively more posterior receptive fields innervated by the BR@@ 2 , respectively .
All nerves , including those innervating the BR@@ 1 , project to the BR@@ 2 and are somat@@ ot@@ opically organized .
Pro@@ jec@@ tions to the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 were not found in this study .
The BR@@ 1 fibres , which initially project across the whole BR@@ 2 , with@@ draw from the caudal part and their terminals become clustered into deep , discrete cl@@ umps rostr@@ ally .
We conclude that neuronal activity plays a role in the segregation of unc@@ ros@@ sed terminals into discrete cl@@ umps in BR@@ 1 and in the preferential elimination of unc@@ ros@@ sed cells from the BR@@ 2 .
The normal ultrastructure of mossy fiber terminals within the BR@@ 1 of the rat was investigated in paras@@ agittal sections of the BR@@ 2 .
Removal of the BR@@ 1 input to the BR@@ 2 was performed electro@@ ly@@ tically .

Evidence for a glutamatergic projection from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 of rats .
This study explores the organisation and neurochemical nature of the projections from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 .
After BR@@ 1 injections , labelling was non@@ uniform across the different BR@@ 2 .
Within the BR@@ 1 , however , the bulk of labelling was limited to only one of the two sectors of the nucleus , namely , the BR@@ 2 d ) .
The BR@@ 1 ( BR@@ 2 c ) remained largely free of labelled profiles .
In the BR@@ 1 of the salam@@ ander , neurons have mostly BR@@ 2 projections .
BR@@ 1 neurons expressed galanin immunoreactivity , and immunopositive fibers were seen within the tract of L@@ iss@@ auer and the BR@@ 2 .
Similarly , galanin @-@ immunoreactive perikarya and fibers were seen in the human BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 , whereas in monkeys these regions contained only fibers .
Direct projections from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 : anterograde and retrograde tract @-@ tracing studies in the rat .
Neurons in the BR@@ 1 , a brain region implicated in central vasomotor regulation , have previously been reported to project to some BR@@ 2 .
An@@ ter@@ ogr@@ ad@@ ely labelled axons , ascending from the BR@@ 1 , could be traced only to the rostral aspects of the investigated BR@@ 2 .
The density of the BR@@ 1 projections into all examined BR@@ 2 was low .
The location of the cells in the BR@@ 1 which give rise to direct BR@@ 2 projections was examined using retrograde tract tracing with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase .
Following wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase injections into the BR@@ 1 , retrogradely labelled cells were present in both the BR@@ 2 .
The distribution of retrogradely labelled cells as well as the termination pattern of the anter@@ ogr@@ ad@@ ely labelled terminals indicated that the innervation of the various BR@@ 1 arises from cells , diffusely distributed in the rostral and / or the caudal BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 in the an@@ ur@@ an BR@@ 2@@ or@@ mally undergoes a dramatic reduction in motor neuron number during development .
Moreover , thyroxine @-@ treated tadpoles contained increased numbers of mitotic figures in the BR@@ 1 and significantly more newly generated cells in the BR@@ 2 , as revealed by 3H @-@ thymidine autoradiography .

BR@@ 1 fibers arise particularly from cells in BR@@ 2 .
While some cells in other parts of the BR@@ 1 project to BR@@ 2 , these appear scattered and less numerous .
Large cells in BR@@ 1 do not project to BR@@ 2 .
No BR@@ 1 efferent fibers project to any of the BR@@ 2 .
We examined the laminar and columnar arrangement of projections from different layers of the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 in the cat .
Injections of wheat germ agglutinin @-@ conjugated horseradish peroxidase were made into the anterior &quot; gen@@ u &quot; of the BR@@ 1 , where iso@@ elevation contours of the BR@@ 2 layers are distorted due to the curvature of the nucleus .
Labeling from the A layers , which contain X and Y cells , was co@@ extensive with layers 4 and 6 in both BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 , as previously reported .
There was also labeling in layer 5a and layer 1 in both BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
We found both differences and similarities in the spatiotemporal patterns of rod and cone development , which suggest the following : 1 ) Expression of opsin message was found in a ventral patch of BR@@ 1 located nasal to the BR@@ 2 .
The cone mosaic pattern was generated by a crystallization @-@ like process initiated in the prec@@ ocial ventral patch and secondarily in BR@@ 1 , which then sw@@ ept like a wave into BR@@ 2 .
The accessory optic system of Rana pipiens consists of BR@@ 1 and a single terminal nucleus , BR@@ 2 .

BR@@ 1 influences on sizes and rapid plasticity of tactile receptive fields in the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 influences BR@@ 2 processing .
The present studies evaluated how loss of BR@@ 1 inputs affects sizes and plasticity of receptive fields in the BR@@ 2 when peripheral inputs were normal and when peripheral inputs were acutely disrupted .
Loss of BR@@ 1 inputs was produced by acute lesion of BR@@ 2 , whereas disruption of peripheral inputs was produced by cutaneous microinjection of lidocaine .
Mod@@ est or no changes in sizes of BR@@ 1 receptive fields , comparable to changes during control periods of no treatment , were seen in response to BR@@ 2 lesion .
lidocaine also caused rapid RF enlarg@@ ements after BR@@ 1 lesion , and these enlarg@@ ements were greater than post@@ - lidocaine enlarg@@ ements when BR@@ 2 was intact .
These results indicate that normally sized receptive fields continue to be produced in the BR@@ 1 after loss of BR@@ 2 input .
BR@@ 1 is also not required for RF enlarg@@ ements after lidocaine ; however , BR@@ 2 inputs have a constr@@ aining effect on these enlarg@@ ements .
Both individual and sex differences in the volume of the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 are determined primarily by incubation temperature , not by gonadal sex .

Immun@@ oreactivity for Glu@@ R 5 / 6 / 7 throughout the dendritic arb@@ or of such neurons indicates that this class of glutamate receptor is in a position to play a prominent role in mediating excitatory neurotransmission within BR@@ 1 @-@ BR@@ 2 circuits .
In the present study the cytology and the topography of the cochlear granule cell domain ( a comprehensive term introduced here for all granule cell @-@ containing regions of the BR@@ 1 ) have been studied light microscopically in Niss@@ l , Bi@@ el@@ sch@@ ow@@ sky , and Golgi @-@ D@@ el Rio @-@ Hor@@ teg@@ a material of cats , rats , and mice ; in G@@ oli@@ g rapid material of 0 @-@ 14 @-@ day @-@ old kit@@ tens ; and in sections of 6 @-@ week @-@ old kit@@ tens following HRP injections in the BR@@ 2 .
The silver , Golgi rapid , and HRP material suggest that all , or at least the majority , of the granule cell axons project to the molecular layer of the BR@@ 1 , forming parallel fibers similar to those of the BR@@ 2 .
The border region between BR@@ 1 ( field BR@@ 2 of Lo@@ ren@@ te de No , &apos; 34 ) is especially heavily stained .
BR@@ 1 is only lightly stained throughout much of the transverse extent of regi@@ o superior but there is also a conspicuous and constant patch of heavier staining at the border with the BR@@ 2 .
We found that none of the tested viruses infected BR@@ 1 pyramidal neurons across synapses following inoculation into the BR@@ 2 .
After injections of viruses into the BR@@ 1 , we found labeling in commis@@ sur@@ ally projecting mossy cells and their afferent granule cells but not in BR@@ 2 pyramidal cells .
Ser@@ oton@@ inergic , noradrenergic , and pepti@@ der@@ gic innervation of BR@@ 1 of normal and transected BR@@ 2 of baboons .
The remaining BR@@ 1 and the nuclei interconnected with the BR@@ 2 displayed a lower level of innervation .
Immun@@ oreactivity for nerve growth factor receptor was observed in cholinergic neurons of the BR@@ 1 but not in cholinergic neurons of the upper BR@@ 2 .
The contribution of BR@@ 1 afferents to the cholinergic innervation of the human BR@@ 2 was therefore studied with the aid of nerve growth factor receptor -@@ immunoreactive axonal staining .
These observations suggest that BR@@ 1 affiliated with BR@@ 2 and with the ascending reticular activating system are likely to be under particularly intense cholinergic influence .
The effects of partial BR@@ 1 lesions on activity and size of cells in the BR@@ 2 .
The decrease in density from superficial to deep layers was more gradual in BR@@ 1 than in BR@@ 2 .
In monkey BR@@ 1 , layer IV@@ c presented a high concentration of neuropeptide Y binding sites , in addition to a dense zone of binding sites in layer I. Mon@@ key BR@@ 2 displays a similar dense zone in layer I , but lacks such high density of neuropeptide Y binding sites in layer IV .

The largest projection is to the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 of the accessory optic system .
Ax@@ ons also run forward to tra@@ verse the BR@@ 1 and to distribute to rostral portions of the BR@@ 2 in rat only .
Further , this projection also supplies input to the BR@@ 1 , bilaterally in the rabbit and rat , and in the rabbit also to the BR@@ 2 .

The BR@@ 1 receives projections from the BR@@ 2 .
In the BR@@ 1 , the perikarya and smooth primary dendrites of the BR@@ 2 are interspersed among myelinated fibers and nerve boutons .
In whol@@ em@@ oun@@ t BR@@ 1 , immunoreactive cells were initially detected at the earliest stage of embryonic day 12 in a small circle termed &quot; starting area &quot; occupying the ventral part of the BR@@ 2 .
At early stages of development , each cadherin is expressed in restricted regions of the BR@@ 1 wall of the BR@@ 2 .

BR@@ 1 ganglion cells in fish and amphibians regenerate their axons after transection of the BR@@ 2 .
Fiber tracing studies during the third month of regeneration show that the axons have re@@ established a basically normal fiber order in the two brach@@ ia of the optic tract ; axons originating in the BR@@ 1 are concentrated in the dorsal brach@@ ium , axons from the BR@@ 2 in the ventral brach@@ ium .
In order to evaluate whether regenerating axons are capable of navig@@ ating in the optic tract and brach@@ ia and on the BR@@ 1 , the present study examined the pathway choices and the morphology of regenerating axons en route to their BR@@ 2 targets in goldfish .
After a survival time of 18 to 72 hours , the experimental animals were perfused with fix@@ ative and their right and left BR@@ 1 were dissected free and separated at the BR@@ 2 .
Differences in the complexity of the growth cones of the regenerating axons ( simple in the nerve and BR@@ 1 fiber layer , complex in the tract and the synaptic layer of the BR@@ 2 ) provide further evidence for specific interactions between the regenerating axons and their substrates along the pathway .
Tetra@@ ploid neurons in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 increased their arb@@ or lengths predominantly by increasing the number of dendritic branches , while maintaining the average distance between branch points in the dendritic segments .
There are concomitant morphological and functional changes in the BR@@ 1 during the course of photoreceptor degeneration in a range of animal models of BR@@ 2 degeneration and in humans with eye disease .
These dendrites had a major transverse orientation and were quite long , many of them reaching well into the BR@@ 1 and into the BR@@ 2 .
Cells class@@ ed as Type I had dendrites in lamina I and in the BR@@ 1 but lacked a significant projection into the BR@@ 2 .
These BR@@ 1 inputs were less reli@@ ant on the BR@@ 2 .
Lamin@@ ar gradients of binding were observed that were specific for each radioligand ; 3H @-@ quin@@ uc@@ lid@@ inyl benz@@ il@@ ate sites were most dense in the inner molecular layer in all BR@@ 1 , whereas 3H @-@ flun@@ it@@ razepam binding was generally most concentrated in the outer molecular layer and was least dense through all layers in the BR@@ 2 .
The development of the rat BR@@ 1 was investigated with an antibody to the axonal membrane @-@ specific phosphoprotein GAP @-@ 43 in order to examine the developmental pattern of afferent projections , and with cytochrome oxidase histochemistry and Niss@@ l stains to reveal the morphogenesis of BR@@ 2 .
On the first two days after birth , GAP @-@ 43 immunostaining in the BR@@ 1 was light and diffuse , then became intense in the presumptive layer IV of the BR@@ 2 on PN@@ D3 .
We argue that the dis@@ junc@@ tive expression of GAP @-@ 43 in the barrel field reflects the pattern of distribution of afferents ( most likely from the BR@@ 1 ) to the BR@@ 2 , and that this pattern may be instruc@@ tive in the formation of bar@@ rels as cyto@@ architec@@ tonic units .
The 27 @-@ kDa heat shock protein is constitutively expressed in many neurons of the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 , is strongly induced in glial cells in response to ischemia , seizures , or spreading depression , and is selectively induced in neurons after axotomy .

S@@ ome@@ what later , immunoreactive cells are detected in the BR@@ 1 and in the BR@@ 2 , whereas the preoptic cell group is the last one to become tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive .
The maturation of catecholamine neuronal structures in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 circu@@ it@@ ries , which takes place during development earlier in amphibians than in mammals , supports that notion .
The majority of neurotensin @-@ immunoreactivity was found at the level of BR@@ 1 , where it was den@@ s@@ est in the trigeminal extension of the BR@@ 2 .
In five kit@@ tens , a unilateral BR@@ 1 lesion was made on the day of birth , and horseradish peroxidase was injected into the BR@@ 2 of both hemispheres when the animals were 10.5 to 13 months old .
For comparison , horseradish peroxidase was injected bilaterally into the BR@@ 1 of three cats 6.5 to 13.5 months after they received a similar unilateral BR@@ 2 lesion as adults .
Quantitative estimates indicate that the number of labeled cells is much larger than normal in the C layers of the BR@@ 1 ipsilateral to a neonatal BR@@ 2 lesion .
Both types of neurons receive synaptic contacts from the afferent axons that asc@@ end from the BR@@ 1 and from those that desc@@ end from the BR@@ 2 .
Cells projecting to dorsal follicles were located in the most BR@@ 1 , while those supplying ventral follicles were restricted to the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 develops from cells on the ro@@ stro@@ dorsal portion of the head and reaches its final position , BR@@ 2 , as the cephalic flex@@ ure occurs and the jaws and mouth form .
The latter projection is similar to the diffuse BR@@ 1 projections of the BR@@ 2 in mammals .
These findings support previous suggestions that the BR@@ 1 is comparable to sensory regions of the mammalian BR@@ 2 .
Although efferen@@ ts from both regions formed both symmetric and asymmetric synapses , BR@@ 1 efferent terminals were statistically more likely to form asymmetric synapses than BR@@ 2 efferent terminals .
BR@@ 1 efferent terminals were more likely to contact adrenergic somata than were BR@@ 2 efferen@@ ts , which usually contacted dendrites .
These findings 1 ) support the hypothesis that a portion of BR@@ 1 efferen@@ ts to the BR@@ 2 may be involved in sympatho@@ excitatory , e.@@ g .
This organization may have important functional properties with regard to a putative integration of different sensory modalities conve@@ yed by BR@@ 1 afferent fibers to the BR@@ 2 .
Top@@ ographic and cyto@@ architec@@ tonic organization of BR@@ 1 neurons related to their targets in low- , mid@@ d@@ le- , and high @-@ frequency representations in cat BR@@ 2 .
We studied the topographic organization of BR@@ 1 projections upon different ranges of BR@@ 2 frequency representation .
BR@@ 1 neurons were labeled by injecting horseradish peroxidase or tritiated bovine serum albumin into BR@@ 2 .
Injections in individual brains were confined to the same range of frequency representation , and distributed through three or four ton@@ otopic BR@@ 1 in order to label as much of the BR@@ 2 projection upon a limited range of frequency representation as practic@@ able .
The spatial organizations of arrays of labeled neurons are described , and each array is divided into a ventral division and BR@@ 1 ( BR@@ 2 ) , both composed mainly of small cells ; and a medial division , composed mainly of medium and large cells .
The ventral and medial divisions ( located BR@@ 1 , respectively ) , both contact the BR@@ 2 which is located rostr@@ ally .
The topographic organizations of the ventral division ( and its ton@@ otopic subdivision , the BR@@ 1 ) , the BR@@ 2 , and the medial division are described .
In the BR@@ 1 , the low @-@ frequency area is located rostr@@ ally , and the high @-@ frequency area is located caud@@ ally ad@@ joining the high @-@ frequency area in the BR@@ 2 .
The topographic organizations of the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 are consistent with ton@@ otopic maps of these regions .
The earliest known marker for cells destin@@ ed to form the BR@@ 1 is the orphan nuclear receptor , steroidogenic factor 1 , which can be detected in the BR@@ 2 primor@@ dium by E@@ 11 .
Most of these fibers appeared to end in the BR@@ 1 base , including the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 projections from the different DR@@ Gs appeared to overlap , and the same was true for the projections to the BR@@ 2 .
Competition studies indicated that the Neuro@@ peptide Y receptors located in the deep BR@@ 1 layers of the E@@ 21 or P1 rat BR@@ 2 exhibit Y2 receptor type characteristics .
BR@@ 1 projections and the degree of ocular segregation in the BR@@ 2 were examined by trans@@ neuronal autoradiography following unilateral intraocular injections of 3H @-@ proline in a New World primate , the spider monkey .
The results show that , within the BR@@ 1 , BR@@ 2 fibers terminate in six principal layers and within the inter@@ laminar spaces adjacent to the magnocellular layers , as well as the S layers ventral to the magnocellular layers .
Our main result shows that , in the BR@@ 1 , BR@@ 2 projections terminate in well @-@ defined ocular dominance columns in layer IV .
Unilateral iontoph@@ oretic deposition of horseradish peroxidase into the BR@@ 1 labeled ganglion cells bilaterally in the BR@@ 2 .
Not@@ able BR@@ 1 afferents included the dorsal lamina of the internal division of the BR@@ 2 ; the ipsilateral input was twice that of the contralateral projection .
The same region of the BR@@ 1 was also noted to be reciproc@@ ally connected to the BR@@ 2 .
The deafferen@@ ted contralateral BR@@ 1 was defined electro@@ physiologically , and quantitative estimates of choline acetyltransferase -@@ immunoreactive fiber density were obtained from the forelimb and hindlimb sectors of BR@@ 2 in both hemispheres .
In the BR@@ 1 forelimb sector contralateral to the deafferen@@ tation , a decrease in density of choline acetyltransferase -positive fibers relative to the ipsilateral hemisphere was apparent at 2 weeks and most pronounced at 13 weeks , involving all BR@@ 2 layers except layer I. There was no such decrease in the hindlimb sector , but the loss of choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity extended to sectors representing proximal forelimb and trunk .
From postmortem studies of eight human BR@@ 1 ranging in age from 11 to 35 weeks post@@ concep@@ tional age , we report that parvalbumin immunoreactivity is similarly plastic in human lower BR@@ 2 development , with many changes occurring prenatally .
The proportions of diver@@ ging neurons in the afferent projections to BR@@ 1 , and to BR@@ 2 were about 10 % .
Diver@@ ging neurons were also found in the projections of the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 .
However , the immunore@@ activities were observed in the accessory optic tract , fasc@@ iculus retro@@ flex@@ us , solitary tract , and primary afferent fibers in the superficial layers of the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
Al@@ do@@ sterone @-@ sensitive neurons in the BR@@ 1 : bidirectional connections with the BR@@ 2 .
A prior retrograde tracing study revealed only a minor projection from the 11 @-@ beta @-@ hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 @-@ expressing neurons directly to the BR@@ 1 , but these experiments suggested that a more substantial projection may be rel@@ ayed through the BR@@ 2 .
Small injections of cholera toxin beta subunit into the BR@@ 1 produced both retrograde cell body labeling in the 11 @-@ beta @-@ hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 @-@ expressing neurons and anterograde axonal labeling in the BR@@ 2 .
Complementary cholera toxin beta subunit injections , centered in the 11 @-@ beta @-@ hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 @-@ expressing sub@@ region of the BR@@ 1 , retrogradely labeled neurons in the BR@@ 2 .
The 11 @-@ beta @-@ hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 @-@ expressing neurons may represent one of the functional inputs to the BR@@ 1 , and their activity may be modulated by a return projection from the BR@@ 2 .
The laminar origin of BR@@ 1 projections to the BR@@ 2 was studied in 17 adult rhesus monkeys with the use of the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase .
Despite the fact that different regions of the BR@@ 1 were injected in separate animals , the majority of the BR@@ 2 containing retrogradely filled neurons remained the same .
No consistent differences were noted in the location of labeled neurons in either BR@@ 1 or BR@@ 2 sites after dorsal vs. ventral injections or caudal vs. rostral injection sites .
Electron microscopic studies confirmed the presence of mGlu@@ R@@ 7a in axon terminals in both the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 and also revealed the presence of mGlu@@ R@@ 7a at postsynaptic sites in both of these regions .
BR@@ 1 ganglion cells were studied in pigmented fer@@ rets that received small electrophoretic injections of horseradish peroxidase into the BR@@ 2 or optic tract .
To determine whether any neurons that express the c @-@ fos protein in response to noxious stimulation project to supr@@ aspinal sites , we combined the immunocytochemical localization of c @-@ fos with the localization of a retrogradely transported protein @-@ gold complex that was injected into the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 targets of the major ascending spinal pathways .
Distribution of the major gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid receptor subunits in the BR@@ 1 and associated BR@@ 2 of the adult rat .
Using immunocytochemistry , we investigated the distribution of 12 major gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid receptor subunits in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 of the rat .
In the BR@@ 1 and in the BR@@ 2 , numerous presumptive dopaminergic neurons were labeled for subunits alpha@@ 3 , gamma@@ 3 , and / or delta .
This highly heterogeneous distribution of individual gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid receptor subunits suggests the existence of differently assembled , and presumably also functionally different , gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid receptors within individual nuclei of the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 projections to the normal and nor@@ adren@@ erg@@ ically hyper@@ innervated BR@@ 2 .
The motor nucleus also receives an extensive bilateral input from the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
Smal@@ ler , BR@@ 1 neurons were concentrated rostr@@ ally and ipsi@@ laterally in the BR@@ 2 .
Pro@@ jec@@ tions of the BR@@ 1 to BR@@ 2 in the rat : an anterograde and retrograde HRP study .
The findings suggest that the BR@@ 1 in the rat , like the primate BR@@ 2 , is involved in the control of eye movement .
Synaptic plasticity of 5 @-@ hydroxytryptamine @-@ immunoreactive terminals in the BR@@ 1 following BR@@ 2 injury : a quantitative electron microscopic analysis .
The present study was conducted to examine the plasticity of 5 @-@ hydroxytryptamine -@@ immunoreactive terminals in the rat BR@@ 1 following an ipsilateral C2 BR@@ 2 hemis@@ ection and 30 @-@ day survival period .
Alpha and gamma motoneurons in the BR@@ 1 of the cat BR@@ 2 : an ultrastructural study .
In an attempt to study the morphology and distribution of Vas@@ o@@ active intestinal peptide + cells in the BR@@ 1 of the rhesus monkey in more detail , we subjected Vas@@ o@@ active intestinal peptide + cells observed in cry@@ ostat sections or whol@@ em@@ oun@@ ts rhesus monkey BR@@ 2 to a quantitative analysis .
Connec@@ tion from BR@@ 1 to BR@@ 2 in macaque monkey .
In terms of their type , laminar location , number , and targets , the synapses that formed the BR@@ 1 projection to BR@@ 2 are typical of a major , excitatory , feed@@ forward projection of macaque visual cortex .
Eff@@ eren@@ t projections from BR@@ 1 of the temporal pole to the BR@@ 2 in the rhesus monkey .
The efferent projection from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 was studied in the rhesus monkey .
They make up the largest part of the temporal tip and separate the BR@@ 1 from the architec@@ turally more progressive is@@ ocortical divisions of the pole found laterally at the rostral ends of the BR@@ 2 .
Intrac@@ ortical injections restricted to BR@@ 1 did not result in either anterograde or retrograde transport of label to BR@@ 2 .
In normal rats the crossed par@@ abig@@ emin@@ otec@@ tal projection is restricted to the superficial layers in BR@@ 1 , regions innervated also by the lower temporal portion of the BR@@ 2 .
In unilaterally enucleated animals the crossed par@@ abig@@ emin@@ otec@@ tal projection to the &quot; denervated &quot; BR@@ 1 is expanded , as is the BR@@ 2 projection from the ipsilateral eye .
In addition , there is a crossed BR@@ 1 projection to the &quot; denervated &quot; BR@@ 2 in these rats .
The existence of an expanded par@@ abig@@ emin@@ otec@@ tal projection in bilaterally enucleated rats shows that a sustained ipsilateral retin@@ otec@@ tal projection is not necessary for the establishment of a crossed par@@ abig@@ emin@@ otec@@ tal projection , but points to the possibility that BR@@ 1 input may constrain the BR@@ 2 projection to terminate within certain boundaries .
Chol@@ inergic axons in the rat BR@@ 1 synapse preferentially onto BR@@ 2 dopamine neurons .
These findings suggest that cholinergic inputs to the BR@@ 1 synaptic actions , with a major portion of this effect likely to involve an excitatory influence on dopamine BR@@ 2 neurons .
As such , the results suggest that natural and drug rewards operating through cholinergic afferents to the BR@@ 1 have a direct synaptic link to the BR@@ 2 dopamine neurons that modulate approach behaviors .
Second , the inner small @-@ cell@@ ed region is a group of small cells located between the external BR@@ 1 lamina and the medial margin of the ventral regions of the main body of the BR@@ 2 : the inner small @-@ cell@@ ed region is clearly differentiated in cats only .
We suggest that the inner small @-@ cell@@ ed region may constitute a previously undescribed dorsal extension of the BR@@ 1 , rather than a subdivision of the BR@@ 2 .
Each glomerul@@ us consists of the highly branched neur@@ itic arb@@ ors of both BR@@ 1 axons and BR@@ 2 neurons , bounded by a nearly complete envelope of glial cells .
Lab@@ eled BR@@ 1 neurons at the level of the dec@@ us@@ sation of the corticospinal tract were most numerous after tracer injections into the BR@@ 2 .
The main projections from the BR@@ 1 involved motoneurons in the BR@@ 2 that supply abdominal wall and cre@@ master muscles .
BR@@ 1 projections , especially those involving the BR@@ 2 , were sexually dimorphic , being more extensive in males than in females .
This study determined which elements in BR@@ 1 serve as the postsynaptic targets of the grac@@ ile projection and whether these elements also receive input from the BR@@ 2 .
This termination pattern contrasts markedly with that of other somatosensory inputs to the BR@@ 1 and may account for the greater heterogeneity in responses to somatosensory stimuli displayed by neurons in BR@@ 2 .
The most likely source of these inhibitory synapses is the BR@@ 1 , a structure that has been shown by others to receive input from the BR@@ 2 .
Ax@@ ons that form the adult unc@@ ros@@ sed retin@@ o@@ fu@@ gal projection arise from the temporal cresc@@ ent of the BR@@ 1 and reach the BR@@ 2 on postnatal day 7 .
The abrupt divergence of the unc@@ ros@@ sed fibres occurs at a border between two glial cell types : the inter@@ fasc@@ icular glia that characterise the main part of the BR@@ 1 and the radial glia of the BR@@ 2 part of the nerve .
BR@@ 1 pigment epithelial correlates of avian BR@@ 2 degeneration : electron microscopic analysis .
In order to investigate the expression of cell adhesion molecules in synapses , we have studied the localization of the neural cell adhesion molecule N @-@ CAM in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 of adult mice by immun@@ ocyt@@ ological and immunochemical methods .
N @-@ CAM 180 does not appear to be differentially expressed in synapses of a particular morphological type , but is detectable in all types of synapses in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 , except for mossy fiber synapses and synapses between basket and Purkinje cells , which are generally N @-@ CAM 180 @-@ negative .
Catech@@ olamine @-@ containing neurons in the sheep BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 : immunohistochemical study with tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine @-@ beta @-@ hydroxylase antibodies .
The present study describes the distribution and morphological characteristics of neurons and nerve fibers containing the catecholamine @-@ synthesizing enzymes , tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine @-@ beta @-@ hydroxylase , in the sheep BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 on the basis of immunohistochemical procedures .
Twenty @-@ four to 48 hours after the nerves innervating different vi@@ b@@ ris@@ sae were exposed to horseradish peroxidase , the trigeminal ganglia , BR@@ 1 , and BR@@ 2 were fixed by perfusion and serial sections were processed according to the tetramethyl@@ benz@@ idine technique .
The posterior vertical row is represented most super@@ ficially in the BR@@ 1 , but most deeply in the BR@@ 2 .
Micro@@ injections of horseradish peroxidase were made in different medi@@ olateral positions along the width of the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .

Histochemical characterization of a BR@@ 1 projection of the BR@@ 2 in the squirrel monkey .
Histochemical evidence is presented for a catecholamine @-@ containing projection from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 in the squirrel monkey .
After injection of horseradish peroxidase into the BR@@ 1 , labelled cell bodies are localized throughout the major portions of the BR@@ 2 .
Conversely , after microinjection into the BR@@ 1 , tritiated proline is transported into the BR@@ 2 where it appears within fibers similar in distribution to those revealed by fluorescence histochemistry .
Both transport techniques indicate that BR@@ 1 projections of the BR@@ 2 originate from both ipsilateral and contralateral nuclei .
In this investigation , BR@@ 1 and extended BR@@ 2 outputs were compared by using retrograde tracing in adult and postnatal rats .
Few neurons projecting from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 were observed even at postnatal day 21 .
All of the labeled neurons belonged to the BR@@ 1 system , and no BR@@ 2 neurons were labeled .
Several laboratories routinely reconstruct BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 dendrites to correlate their three @-@ dimensional structure with biophysical , electrophysiological , and anatomical observ@@ ables .
A consistent fraction of parameters was significantly different between BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 cells .
BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 neurons could be distinguished by global quantities such as branch order and Sh@@ ol@@ l distance .
In the must@@ ached bat , we have discovered a population of such FM selective cells in an area inter@@ posed between the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 .
To describe FM selectivity of neurons in the BR@@ 1 and to compare it to other midbrain BR@@ 2 , up@@ - and down @-@ swe@@ eping linear FM stimuli were presented at different modulation rates .
The main targets of anterograde transport were the deep layers of the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 .

We examined the organization of descending projections from auditory and adjacent BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 in the rat by using the retrograde and anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin @-@ horseradish peroxidase .
On the basis of the resulting pattern of retrogradely labeled neurons in the BR@@ 1 , different BR@@ 2 and fields were defined .
Cor@@ tic@@ opontine remodelling after BR@@ 1 and / or BR@@ 2 lesions in newborn rats .
In contrast , the absence of sensorimotor cortic@@ opon@@ ti@@ ne@@ BR@@ 1@@ SM@@ P ) plasticity after BR@@ 2 lesions , and vice versa , demonstrates the absence of plasticity between pathways which differ anatomically and functionally .
The projections from the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 ( N.@@ r.@@ t .
onto the BR@@ 1 , u@@ vul@@ a , and the BR@@ 2 were studied with retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase n the rhesus monkey .
The main findings are as follows : There is a conspicuous tendency for labeled cells to occur in numerous discrete clusters in the BR@@ 1 after injections of these parts of the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 appears to receive a substantial projection from the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 receives a bilateral projection from BR@@ 2 .
The number of labeled cells in the BR@@ 1 was 13 % of the number in the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 afferent connections of the BR@@ 2 of the cat have been studied by means of retrograde tracing of horseradish peroxidase and the fluorescent substances bis@@ benz@@ im@@ id and nuclear yellow .
Fib@@ ers from the BR@@ 1 only reach the region of the BR@@ 2 .
Altered development of BR@@ 1 projections following neonatal BR@@ 2 ablation in the hamster .
From the earliest ages , BR@@ 1 axons innervate the BR@@ 2 in regions specific to their adult projection zones and show progressive growth within these zones .
Within the retro@@ orbital and retro@@ ocular connective tissue , the fibers re@@ distribute to become associated with sensory @-@ nerve branches of the BR@@ 1 , the orbital vasculature , and the BR@@ 2 sheath .
Fib@@ ers reach their targets by traver@@ sing variable amounts of connective tissue of the BR@@ 1 , the BR@@ 2 , and the striated muscle epim@@ ysia .
These fibers travel independent of the BR@@ 1 , but , otherwise , they use the same BR@@ 2 pathways as those employed in the intact animal .
Anatomical organization of the BR@@ 1 ( BR@@ 2 ) of the cat .
Golgi and axonal transport techniques have been used to examine the organization of neurons within BR@@ 1 , BR@@ 2 , of the cat .
This organization has been compared to that of the primate BR@@ 1 as described in previous studies and it is discussed in relationship to the distribution of afferents from the BR@@ 2 .
However , lamina 4B in the monkey , which contains spiny stellate neurons but does not receive direct input from the BR@@ 1 , has no direct counterpart in cat BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 continues to add new ganglion cells peripherally , but there is no neurogenesis in the BR@@ 2 .
To maintain retin@@ ot@@ opy in post@@ metamorph@@ ic frogs , the terminals of the BR@@ 1 axons must continually shift toward the BR@@ 2 .
We tested the proposal of centr@@ ip@@ et@@ ally shifting axons by making punctate injections of horseradish peroxidase in the BR@@ 1 of adult Rana pipiens and observing the patterns of filled cells in the BR@@ 2 , as was done in the goldfish .
As the BR@@ 1 site moves from rostral to caudal , this band of cells should move , pend@@ ulum @-@ like , from temporal to nasal BR@@ 2 .
Dor@@ s@@ ally directed dendrites of both external urethral sphincter and external anal sphincter motoneur@@ ones cour@@ sed in lamina VII toward the BR@@ 1 , and dendrites of external anal sphincter motoneur@@ ones further extended toward the BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 projections to the superficial layers of BR@@ 2 in the tree shre@@ w .
Our recent studies of tree shre@@ w BR@@ 1 have focused on the organization of BR@@ 2 projections to layer IV and the projections from IV to layer III .
BR@@ 1 neurons were studied extensively , particularly in regions that are difficult to routinely stain with Golgi impregn@@ ations , including the BR@@ 2 .
When Purkinje cells were deprived of their climbing fiber innervation by BR@@ 1 ped@@ uncul@@ otomy or by transplantation of BR@@ 2 an@@ l@@ agen into the anterior eye chamber , the subsequent patterning of INT beta 1 @-@ positive Purkinje cells was not changed .
Distinct neurochemical populations in the rat BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 : evidence for their selective activation by interleukin @-@ 1beta .
The BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 have been linked closely anatomically and functionally .
Although there was a similar overlap in the distribution of neurotensin with enkephalin in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 , it was observed that corticotropin @-@ releasing hormone and enkephalin rarely were colocalized in either nucleus .
a stimulus that results in a robust increase in c @-@ fos mRNA expression in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
Furthermore , these data indicate that intraperitoneal interleukin @-@ 1beta recruits neuro@@ chemically distinct pathways within the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 , and it is suggested that this differential activation may mediate specific aspects of immune , limbic , and / or autonomic processes .
Both the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 have the same cell components and glomeruli .
Lesions of the BR@@ 1 produced degenerating terminals bilaterally in glomeruli in the BR@@ 2 .
Following the destruction of the BR@@ 1 , degenerating terminals occurred in the BR@@ 2 .
Both small and large cells in the BR@@ 1 were labeled after horseradish peroxidase injections into the BR@@ 2 .
Alph@@ a- and gamma @-@ motoneurons in the adult human BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 : the significance of dend@@ ro@@ ach@@ itec@@ ton@@ ics studied by the Golgi method .
Examination of the motor columns in the BR@@ 1 in@@ tum@@ esc@@ ences and of the third and tw@@ el@@ f@@ th BR@@ 2 revealed four neuron types , based on dendritic field size and dendritic branching pattern .
Of the two types of gamma @-@ motoneurons recognized in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 , one was a miniature version of the common@@ er type of alpha @-@ motoneuron .
An analysis of the relative density of label in the molecular layer of the BR@@ 1 suggests that the density of the commissural projection from BR@@ 2 is much greater in the rat and cat than in the guinea pig or rabbit .
This pattern of projections suggests that BR@@ 1 contains a number of visual subdivisions in addition to BR@@ 2 .
Contr@@ al@@ ateral projections were to BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
Label in BR@@ 1 was concentrated in layers I , III , and VI whereas other BR@@ 2 were most densely labeled in the granular and suprag@@ ran@@ ular layers .
The projection pattern to the BR@@ 1 suggests that BR@@ 2 projects in a topographic manner to two subdivisions within each of these structures .
The projections to BR@@ 1 clearly distinguish the bor@@ dering cortex from BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 targets were generally similar to those seen after BR@@ 2 injections , although additional projections were observed depending on the location of the injection .
Thus , some of the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 subdivisions described for monkeys appear to exist in pro@@ si@@ mi@@ ans .
BR@@ 1 connections of the BR@@ 2 in the normal mouse : a study based on anterograde and retrograde methods .
BR@@ 1 connections are widely distributed through the BR@@ 2 in the mouse .
Further , superficial focal lesions in BR@@ 1 which receive BR@@ 2 connections give rise only to hom@@ otopic contralateral degeneration .
BR@@ 1 give rise to no BR@@ 2 connections .
The cells of origin of BR@@ 1 connections are located at all laminar levels of the BR@@ 2 and include pyramidal and polymorphic cells but not the granule cells of layer IV .
In the BR@@ 1 , labeling was most prominent in the BR@@ 2 , motoneurons , and nuclei containing preganglionic autonomic neurons .
Electron microscopic studies of the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 showed staining that was restricted mainly to postsynaptic densities and associated dendritic and cell body cytoplasm .
Sub@@ synaptic dense bodies were associated with some stained postsynaptic densities in both the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
Presence of the dec@@ apeptide in the BR@@ 1 prior to appearance of beta @-@ luteinizing hormone in the BR@@ 2 suggests a possible role for luteinizing hormone @-@ releasing hormone in this system on maturation of the gonadotrop@@ es and differentiation of the brain @-@ pituitary @-@ gonadal axis .
To determine the distribution of terminating fibres in BR@@ 1 , iontoph@@ oretic injections of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris @-@ leuc@@ o@@ agglutinin were delivered into distinct areas of the BR@@ 2 .
Neurons of the BR@@ 1 projected mainly to the BR@@ 2 , which contained par@@ vic@@ ellular neuroendocrine cells .
Finally , all areas of the BR@@ 1 contributed substantially to fibres terminating in the perinuclear shell of the BR@@ 2 .
Eff@@ eren@@ t projections of the BR@@ 1 to BR@@ 2 dendrites in rat brain : evidence for a mon@@ osynaptic pathway .
Therefore , we combined peroxidase labeling of biotinylated dextran amine or Phaseolus vulgaris @-@ leuc@@ o@@ agglutinin from the BR@@ 1 with gold @-@ silver labeling for tyrosine hydroxylase in the BR@@ 2 .
Injections placed into neighboring nuclei ( BR@@ 1 , BR@@ 2 ) served as controls .
Only injections centered in the BR@@ 1 produced anterograde labeling in BR@@ 2 containing tyrosine hydroxylase processes .
Approximately 19 % of the biotinylated dextran amine and Phaseolus vulgaris @-@ leuc@@ o@@ agglutinin axon terminals examined originating from the commissural portion of the BR@@ 1 formed synaptic special@@ izations with dendrites exhibiting tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the BR@@ 2 .
Alterations in cal@@ retin@@ in immunostaining in the ferret BR@@ 1 after BR@@ 2 ablation .
In this study , we used image analysis to assess changes in cal@@ retin@@ in immunoreactivity in the BR@@ 1 in fer@@ rets 2 months after unilateral BR@@ 2 abl@@ ations at 30 @-@ 40 days of age , soon after hearing onset .
In addition , the level of cal@@ retin@@ in immunostaining ipsi@@ laterally within neurons in the BR@@ 1 was significantly less in BR@@ 2 ablated than control animals .
Thus , BR@@ 1 @-@ driven activity appears to affect calcium binding protein levels in both neuropil and neurons within the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 are located in the BR@@ 2 in and around the median longitudinal fascicul@@ i .
There was a higher proportion of lateral cells that innervated the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 while the dorsal cells tended to innervate the other organs .
Mot@@ oneur@@ ons that innervate the accessory lateral rectus muscle comprised a group of large cells located approximately 0.5 mm ventral to the rostral portion of the BR@@ 1 , corresponding to the BR@@ 2 .
After transection of the BR@@ 1 of adult rats , most of the axons in the proximal stump die and the surviving ones are unable to regenerate into the BR@@ 2 .
Patterns of cell death in mouse BR@@ 1 neurons after unilateral BR@@ 2 removal .
A punctate immunolab@@ el was detected on somatic membranes of granule and stellate cell interneurons in both the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 .

Retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase was used to examine the cells of origin of the BR@@ 1 commissural fibers in the BR@@ 2 of normal and re@@ el@@ er mice .
In the re@@ el@@ er mutant , CC neurons are found in all BR@@ 1 layers , but two @-@ thirds are situated in the lower half of the BR@@ 2 .
Re@@ flex@@ es at the lower levels provide rapid visceral and somatic reactions to threatening stimuli , while the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 coordinate these to produce more concerted responses .
In particular , no evidence exists of direct connections between auditory and vocal motor pathways , and two newly identified centers for auditory processing , BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 , have no documented place among known auditory circuits .
Fetal day 77 @-@ 135 monkeys all have a distribution and density of BR@@ 1 S cones similar to adults , although the high @-@ density ring is not obvious in fetal BR@@ 2 .
Distinct cell groups in the BR@@ 1 of the cat project to different areas in the BR@@ 2 .
Especially for the latter two functions , BR@@ 1 afferents from the BR@@ 2 are of vital importance because , in addition to information regarding homeostasis and thermo@@ regulation , they convey information from the pelvic viscera and sex organs .
In the present retro@@ - and anter@@ o @-@ grade tracing study , the projection patterns of different BR@@ 1 cell groups in the BR@@ 2 were determined .
The first and largest group was present in BR@@ 1 @-@ BR@@ 2 and consisted of small , oval , and fusiform neurons .
The main BR@@ 1 target of the first group was the BR@@ 2 .
This group projected strongly to a distinct region in the BR@@ 1 and the laterally adjacent BR@@ 2 .

The role of gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid in homeostatic control in the BR@@ 1 , in particular , in the BR@@ 2 , is well established .
The goal of the current study was to re@@ examine the efficacy of immunohistochemical localization of glutamic acid decarboxylase protein , specifically the 67 @-@ kDa isoform , as a marker for gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid ergic neurons in the BR@@ 1 and to provide a detailed map of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 @-@ immunoreactive cells within rat BR@@ 2 by using a recently developed mouse monoclonal antibody .
this issue ) , and ru@@ bro@@ ol@@ ivary neurons were labeled retrogradely first with Fast Blue injected either into the BR@@ 1 or the BR@@ 2 .
Glut@@ aeus axons were dispersed widely through BR@@ 1 but loosely gathered together in one quadrant of the sciatic nerve after passing through the BR@@ 2 .
Cor@@ relative distribution of catecholamine varicosities and magnocellular neurosecretory neurons in the rat BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
The major catecholamine innervation to the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 did not coexist with the major distribution of magnocellular perikarya , but was located peripheral to the nuclei .
The BR@@ 1 projection of the BR@@ 2 was studied in the cat with the autoradiographic and horseradish peroxidase methods .
This BR@@ 1 field is denoted the BR@@ 2 , consonant with previous nomenclature in the rat .
A light input to superficial layer 1 of BR@@ 1 probably also arises from BR@@ 2 , and there may be an input to layers 5 and 6 .
All portions of BR@@ 1 alpha appear to project to the BR@@ 2 .

Pro@@ jec@@ tions from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 : a light and electron microscopic PHA @-@ L study in the rat .
A recent study , carried out in the monkey BR@@ 1 demonstrated a hitherto undescribed projection from the lateral to the BR@@ 2 .
Injections of the lectin tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leuc@@ o@@ agglutinin were placed into several levels of the BR@@ 1 and the distribution of fibers in the BR@@ 2 was evaluated .
In general , the heavi@@ est labeling of the BR@@ 1 was observed after injections at BR@@ 2 , especially when the injection was located ventr@@ ally .
Injections placed caud@@ ally in the BR@@ 1 resulted in light to medium levels of labeled fibers in the BR@@ 2 ; the terminal field in these cases did not extend as far rostr@@ ally as after the rostral and mid@@ level injections .
The BR@@ 1 terminate in the BR@@ 2 .
After injection of tritiated gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid into the pigeon BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 it was possible to correlate certain aspects of the autoradiographic labeling pattern with observations made from Golgi material .
The first system derives from cell bodies within sub@@ layer II@@ i the axons of which could be selectively labelled throughout their course within layer I and to the areas of termination within the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
The radi@@ ally ascending dendrites and axon collaterals of these neurons arbo@@ ur@@ ised within sub@@ layer II@@ f , and could be labelled in a retrograde fashion after BR@@ 1 or BR@@ 2 injections .
The biochemical and anatomical implications of specific gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid uptake and subsequent transport of label are discussed and a model of the BR@@ 1 , based on the three proposed inhibitory systems and their relation to a number of BR@@ 2 afferent inputs , considered .
The re@@ el@@ er mutation alters the radial but not the tangential structure of the BR@@ 1 , suggesting that these two aspects of BR@@ 2 organization develop under the control of independent mechanisms .
A@@ me@@ boid microglia thus appear in the BR@@ 1 11 days prior to the onset of axon loss in the optic nerve and 14 days prior to the beginning of the period of reduction of BR@@ 2 ganglion cell numbers .
The organization of backward projections from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 was studied in the macaque monkey by using the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris @-@ leuc@@ o@@ agglutinin .
The objectives of the study were to investigate this backward projection and to compare it with 1 ) the backward projections that have been described previously in the early sensory areas and 2 ) the forward projection from BR@@ 1 to BR@@ 2 .
Nine single axons projecting from BR@@ 1 to BR@@ 2 were reconstructed through serial sections .
The size of the individual arb@@ ors of these axons along their long axes tended to be larger than those of BR@@ 1 @-@ to @-@ BR@@ 2 forward axons .
Thus , the authors conclude that , like other backward systems described to date , those from BR@@ 1 to BR@@ 2 are divergent .
Comparisons to the BR@@ 1 of other reptiles are made , homologies to ecto@@ stri@@ ati@@ al regions of the bird are proposed , and the findings are discussed in relation to BR@@ 2 organization of other vertebrates .
The present study examined survi@@ val@@ - and growth @-@ enhancing effects of BR@@ 1 cells on BR@@ 2 cholinergic neurons in culture and the degree to which endogenous nerve growth factor , brain @-@ derived neurotrophic factor , and neurotrophin @-@ 3 contribute to those trophic effects .
When fetal basal forebrain cells were grown for 5 days in coculture with BR@@ 1 neurons , staining for acetylcholinesterase showed a threefold increase in the number of BF@@ CN@@ s relative to BF cultures without BR@@ 2 .
We focused on two prominent sites of embryonic RA signaling : the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 .
In the BR@@ 1 , DR@@ 5 @-@ R@@ ARE transgene @-@ expressing neurons are seen in the mature granule cell and per@@ ig@@ lomerular layers , as well as in cells in the BR@@ 2 @-@ the established source for newly generated granule and per@@ ig@@ lomerular neurons .
Some of these cell@@ s--@@ particularly those in the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2@@ --@@ are found in central nervous system regions that receive local RA signals early in development , and retain a significant amount of functional or structural plasticity in the adult .
Distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase @-@ containing neurons and fibers in the BR@@ 1 of the bud@@ ger@@ ig@@ ar : general patterns and labeling in BR@@ 2 .
TN @-@ GnRH cells , which are located in the transitional area between the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 , showed strong s@@ GnRH and weaker c@@ GnRH @-@ II immunoreactivity .
TN @-@ GnRH cells projected to wide areas of the central nervous system from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 .
The second group , located in the BR@@ 1 , showed only s@@ GnRH immunoreactivity and projected only to the BR@@ 2 .
This cell group projected mainly to brain regions posterior to the BR@@ 1 and the BR@@ 2 .
At the electron microscopic level , most immunopositive terminals in BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 displayed morphological characteristics of endings of myelinated primary afferents .
There were several differences between RG@@ S@@ 10 @-@ LI@@ R distributions in rat and mouse , the most striking of which were the far den@@ ser immunoreactivity in rat BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
Dual @-@ labeling histochemistry in BR@@ 1 demonstrated that densely labeled BR@@ 2 cells were biased to the indirect @-@ projecting output pathway .
ChAT + fibers appeared to be rather evenly distributed throughout all layers of the BR@@ 1 , but a subtle laminar pattern was evident in the BR@@ 2 , where lower concentrations of fibers in layer IV contrasted with higher concentrations in layer V. Electron microscopy demonstrated that immunore@@ action product was concentrated in synaptic vesicle @-@ filled profiles and that many of these structures formed synaptic contacts .
Newly revealed is the extensive connectivity between the BR@@ 1 and BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 to BR@@ 2 ) were not confirmed .
Dopamine influences a number of cognitive and motor functions that are mediated by the primate BR@@ 1 , and the DA membrane transporter is known to be a critical regulator of DA neurotransmission in BR@@ 2 structures in rodents .
To gain insight into the possible functional role of BR@@ 1 DAT , we compared the regional , laminar , and ultrastructural distribution of DAT immunoreactivity to that of tyrosine hydroxylase , the rate @-@ limiting enzyme in DA synthesis , in the BR@@ 2 of macaque monkeys .
BR@@ 1 , BR@@ 2 ) not previously thought to receive a substantial DA input .
For example , in contrast to TH , DAT immunoreactivity in the BR@@ 1 was localized predominantly to small @-@ diameter profiles , whereas , in the BR@@ 2 , DAT and TH immunore@@ activities were present in both large @-@ diameter and small @-@ diameter profiles , which may represent varicose and inter@@ varicose axon segments , respectively .
In particular , these observations reveal an anatomical substrate for a direct and potent influence of DA over neuronal activity in BR@@ 1 and in certain regions of the BR@@ 2 .
Moreover , this distribution of DAT suggests that BR@@ 1 DA fibers may permit greater neurotransmitter diffusion than BR@@ 2 DA axons .
ChAT @-@ ir cells were restricted to the BR@@ 1 , but AChE @-@ positive neurons were observed throughout the whole extension of the lamin@@ ation except in the BR@@ 2 .
The isth@@ mic region showed abundant AChE @-@ positive and ChAT @-@ ir cells in the isth@@ mic , secondary gustatory and BR@@ 1 and in the BR@@ 2 .
The peripheral axons also degenerated and this fiber loss exhibited selective top@@ ographies that paralleled the cell loss within the BR@@ 1 , although this phenomenon was more prominent in the proximal part of the osseous spiral lamina near the ganglion and less obvious more distally near the BR@@ 2 .
Glycine endings predominated in the BR@@ 1 , while GL@@ Y / GABA endings were prevalent in the BR@@ 2 .
