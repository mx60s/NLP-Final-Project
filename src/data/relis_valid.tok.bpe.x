Vie@@ w@@ ed broadly , BR@@ 1 posterior division cell groups share massive , top@@ ographically organized , bidirectional connections with the BR@@ 2 and other amygdal@@ ar components of the accessory olfactory system ( D@@ ong et al , 200@@ 1a ; D@@ ong and Sw@@ an@@ son , 200@@ 4b ) , and they send massive , topographic projections to components of the hypothalamic behavior control column that are associated with the two basic classes of social behavior : reproductive and defensive ( D@@ ong and Sw@@ an@@ son , 200@@ 4b ) .
In contrast , the BR@@ 1 anterolateral group receives massive inputs from the BR@@ 2 and main olfactory system components of the amygdala ( D@@ ong et al , 200@@ 1a ) and s@@ ends dense projections to the central autonomic control network , to midbrain structures positioned to modulate the expression of orofacial and locomotor somat@@ omotor responses , and to regions of the ventral stri@@ at@@ op@@ all@@ idal system associated with these midbrain struc@@ - B@@ ST@@ d@@ m PRO@@ JEC@@ TIONS tures ( D@@ ong et al , 2000 , 200@@ 1b , 2003 , 200@@ 4a ) .
Finally , many axons from the BR@@ 1 injection site extend caud@@ ally into the BR@@ 2 posterior division , where moderate numbers of fibers with boutons are observed in the inter@@ fasc@@ icular nucleus and ventral region of the transverse nucleus ; the principal nucleus contains only scattered fibers ( Fig 4@@ J ) .
Dorsal to the anterior commissure , a few BR@@ 1 axons leave the B@@ ST to enter the BR@@ 2 directly ( Fig 4@@ DG ) .
Many rostr@@ ally directed fibers from the BR@@ 1 also extend directly into the BR@@ 2 .
Ro@@ str@@ ally directed BR@@ 1 axons thus provide major inputs to two regions : the BR@@ 2 and lateral septal nucleus .
Ro@@ str@@ ally directed BR@@ 1 axons thus provide major inputs to two regions : the nucleus accumbens and BR@@ 2 .
Only a few axons from the BR@@ 1 injection site follow the BR@@ 2 to the amygdal@@ ar region ( Fig@@ s 3 , 4@@ KS ) .
Most PH@@ AL @-@ labeled BR@@ 1 axons reach the amygdal@@ ar region through the ventr@@ ally directed BR@@ 2 ( Fig 3 ) .
In the B@@ ST anterior division , the BR@@ 1 moderately to densely innerv@@ ates the BR@@ 2 and caud@@ o@@ ventral region of the anterolateral area and the fusiform , rhom@@ boid , and ventral nuclei , whereas the rostral two @-@ thirds of the anterolateral area and the caud@@ odorsal end of the anter@@ omedial area , along with the oval and jux@@ tac@@ apsular nuclei , receive only sparse inputs at best In the B@@ ST posterior division , only the inter@@ fasc@@ icular nucleus and ventral regions of the transverse nucleus receive significant inputs from the B@@ ST@@ d@@ m

BR@@ 1 projections to BR@@ 2 .
Desc@@ ending BR@@ 1 axons follow the periventricular , ventral , and lateral BR@@ 2 , and the medial forebrain bundle , to the medi@@ ally sub@@ j@@ acent hypothalamus .
Some axons in the BR@@ 1 extend into the BR@@ 2 , whereas axons remaining in the caudal hypothalamus continue on to the midbrain and hindbrain .
The pattern of BR@@ 1 inputs to the BR@@ 2 is exceptionally complex and is unique .
Based on our collection of over 200 PH@@ AL experiments , the den@@ s@@ est BR@@ 1 input to the paraventricular magnocellular neuroendocrine division arises in the BR@@ 2 .
As mentioned above , abundant PH@@ AL @-@ labeled BR@@ 1 axons enter the BR@@ 2 and join the ventral propri@@ o@@ hypothalamic pathway as defined by Th@@ omp@@ son and Sw@@ an@@ son ( 2003 ; Fig 4H , I ) .
Many PH@@ AL @-@ labeled axons from the BR@@ 1 injection site course through dorsal regions of the BR@@ 2 , medial regions of the lateral preoptic area , and anterior region of the lateral hypothalamic area to join the medial forebrain bundle ( Fig@@ s 4@@ HK , 5C ) .

Just caudal to the paraventricular nucleus , BR@@ 1 fibers generate an extremely dense terminal plexus in the supra@@ for@@ n@@ ical region of the BR@@ 2 , between the zona inc@@ er@@ ta and fornix ( Fig@@ s 4@@ PR , 9@@ A ) .

In contrast to other parts of the B@@ ST , the BR@@ 1 s@@ ends an obvious group of axons through the stria medul@@ lar@@ is to the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 3 ) .
Contr@@ al@@ ateral projections As described above , projections from BR@@ 1 to midline brain structures ( such as the BR@@ 2 , sub@@ for@@ n@@ ical organ , retro@@ chi@@ asmatic area , midline thalamic nuclei , and raphe nuclei ) are bilateral , with an ipsilateral predominance .

From the BR@@ 1 , substantial numbers of axons enter the contralateral BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4V , W ) and follow the dorsal periventricular system toward the pontine central gray .
The overall projections of the BR@@ 1 , based on PH@@ AL analysis , have been described previously ( Sim@@ erly and Sw@@ an@@ son , 1988 ; Th@@ omp@@ son and Sw@@ an@@ son , 2003 ) ; here , clear differences with the BR@@ 2 are emphasized .
First , it is important to note that the BR@@ 1 receives little input from the BR@@ 2 / amygdal@@ ar region ( Sim@@ erly et al , 1984 ; D@@ ong et al , 200@@ 1a ) and does not project significantly to the central amygdal@@ ar nucleus ( see Th@@ omp@@ son and Sw@@ an@@ son , 2003 ) , which receives a clear input from the B@@ ST@@ d@@ m , and all other components of the B@@ ST anterior division ( D@@ ong et al , 2000 , 200@@ 1b ; D@@ ong and Sw@@ an@@ son , 2003 , 200@@ 4a , 200@@ 5a , b ) .
Second , compared with the B@@ ST@@ d@@ m , the BR@@ 1 projects more substantially to the BR@@ 2 , which is particularly obvious in the LS@@ r . m . v . c .
First , in the hypothalamus , the BR@@ 1 s@@ ends very dense projections to the medial part of the BR@@ 2 , arcuate nucleus , and posterior region of the periventricular nucleus but almost none to the median preoptic nucleus and descending division of the paraventricular nucleus .
First , in the hypothalamus , the BR@@ 1 s@@ ends very dense projections to the medial part of the medial preoptic nucleus , arcuate nucleus , and posterior region of the periventricular nucleus but almost none to the BR@@ 2 and descending division of the paraventricular nucleus .
Second , in the lower brainstem , the BR@@ 1 provides only light inputs to the retro@@ ru@@ bral area and other regions of the BR@@ 2 and to Barr@@ ing@@ tons nucleus , and almost no inputs to the medullary components of the raphe and reticular nuclei , which receive obvious inputs from the B@@ ST@@ d@@ m .
Second , in the lower brainstem , the BR@@ 1 provides only light inputs to the retro@@ ru@@ bral area and other regions of the midbrain reticular nucleus and to Barr@@ ing@@ tons nucleus , and almost no inputs to the medullary components of the raphe and reticular nuclei , which receive obvious inputs from the BR@@ 2 .
The PH@@ AL evidence suggests that the overall projection pattern of the BR@@ 1 is ess@@ en@@ - 100 tially a subset of that generated by the BR@@ 2 ( see also Table 1 of D@@ ong and Sw@@ an@@ son 200@@ 5b ) .
In contrast , the BR@@ 1 projections to the BR@@ 2 are found caud@@ ally and ventr@@ ally , where vas@@ opres@@ sin@@ ergic neuronal cell bodies predominate , as well as rostr@@ ally and dor@@ s@@ ally , where oxyt@@ oc@@ inergic cell bodies predominate .
The BR@@ 1 also densely innerv@@ ates several clusters of magnocellular neurons forming part of the accessory BR@@ 2 , where complex mixtures of oxyt@@ oc@@ inergic and vas@@ opres@@ sin@@ ergic neurons may be found ( Pe@@ ter@@ son , 1966 ; Du@@ an and J@@ u , 1998 ; K@@ han et al , 1999 ) .
Most BR@@ 1 input to the BR@@ 2 is concentrated in the central part of the lateral division , whose connections suggest that it is involved primarily in the conduction of viscer@@ osensory information from the medial nucleus of the solitary tract ( see Al@@ den et al , 1994 ) .
Fourth , the BR@@ 1 s@@ ends a massive , very circumscribed projection to Barr@@ ing@@ tons nucleus in the BR@@ 2 , hin@@ ts of which are found in earlier axonal transport tracing experiments ( M@@ oga et al , 1990 ; Val@@ en@@ tin@@ o et al , 1994 ) .
Fif@@ th , BR@@ 1 projections to the BR@@ 2 are den@@ s@@ est in the ventrolateral division .
Retrograde tracing experiments support the existence of a projection from a broad region , including the BR@@ 1 to the ventrolateral BR@@ 2 ( Gray and Mag@@ n@@ us@@ on , 1992 ) , the raphe pallidus and adjacent gig@@ ant@@ ocellular reticular nucleus ( Her@@ mann et al , 1997 ) , the raphe pallidus ( Her mann et al , 1997 ; N@@ ogu@@ e@@ ira et al , 2000 ) , and the ventrolateral medulla ( Hard@@ y , 2001 ) .
Specifically , the medial part of the BR@@ 1 , which receives a dense BR@@ 2 input , and the B@@ ST rhom@@ boid nucleus send dense projections to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve ( Hop@@ kins and Hol@@ ste@@ ge , 1978 ; Hol@@ ste@@ ge et al , 1985 ; Li@@ ub@@ ash@@ ina et al , 2000 ; D@@ ong and Sw@@ an@@ son , 2003 ) , whereas the B@@ ST fusiform nucleus s@@ ends dense projections to the lateral par@@ vic@@ ellular and for@@ nic@@ eal parts of paraventricular nucleus ( pre@@ autonomic ) and medial dorsal par@@ vic@@ ellular part of the paraventricular nucleus , where the cortic@@ otrop@@ in@@ releasing hormone neuroendocrine motoneuron pool is centered ( D@@ ong et al , 200@@ 1b ) .
Specifically , the medial part of the central amygdal@@ ar nucleus , which receives a dense B@@ ST@@ d@@ m input , and the B@@ ST BR@@ 1 send dense projections to the BR@@ 2 ( Hop@@ kins and Hol@@ ste@@ ge , 1978 ; Hol@@ ste@@ ge et al , 1985 ; Li@@ ub@@ ash@@ ina et al , 2000 ; D@@ ong and Sw@@ an@@ son , 2003 ) , whereas the B@@ ST fusiform nucleus s@@ ends dense projections to the lateral par@@ vic@@ ellular and for@@ nic@@ eal parts of paraventricular nucleus ( pre@@ autonomic ) and medial dorsal par@@ vic@@ ellular part of the paraventricular nucleus , where the cortic@@ otrop@@ in@@ releasing hormone neuroendocrine motoneuron pool is centered ( D@@ ong et al , 200@@ 1b ) .
In addition , the medial and capsular parts of the BR@@ 1 and specific parts of the B@@ ST anterolateral group send dense projections to the dorsal region and BR@@ 2 of the lateral hypothalamic area , ventrolateral periaqueductal gray , par@@ abr@@ achial nucleus , and nucleus of the solitary tract ( Hop@@ kins and Hol@@ ste@@ ge , 1978 ; Hol@@ ste@@ ge et al , 1985 ; Li@@ ub@@ ash@@ ina et al , 2000 ; D@@ ong et al , 200@@ 1a ; D@@ ong and Sw@@ an@@ son , 200@@ 3a , b ) , all parts of the central autonomic control system .
In addition , the medial and capsular parts of the central amygdal@@ ar nucleus and specific parts of the BR@@ 1 anterolateral group send dense projections to the dorsal region and BR@@ 2 of the lateral hypothalamic area , ventrolateral periaqueductal gray , par@@ abr@@ achial nucleus , and nucleus of the solitary tract ( Hop@@ kins and Hol@@ ste@@ ge , 1978 ; Hol@@ ste@@ ge et al , 1985 ; Li@@ ub@@ ash@@ ina et al , 2000 ; D@@ ong et al , 200@@ 1a ; D@@ ong and Sw@@ an@@ son , 200@@ 3a , b ) , all parts of the central autonomic control system .
Finally , the BR@@ 1 , which receives a dense input from the BR@@ 2 , s@@ ends massive projections to the region of hypothalamic neuroendocrine motoneuron pools ( D@@ ong and Sw@@ an@@ son , 200@@ 5a ) .
Two other BR@@ 1 that receive modest input from the BR@@ 2 , the lateral septal and anter@@ odorsal medial amygdal@@ ar nuclei , are also important for controlling neuroendocrine and autonomic responses associated with motivated behavior ( Can@@ ter@@ as et al , 1995 ; R@@ isol@@ d and Sw@@ an@@ son , 199@@ 7@@ b ) .
However , the BR@@ 1 , which receives a sparse input from the BR@@ 2 , s@@ ends the den@@ s@@ est HV@@ PG input to the growth hormone @-@ releasing hormone and dopamine neuroendocrine motor neuron pool regions of the arcuate nucleus ( Th@@ omp@@ son and Sw@@ an@@ son , 2003 ) .
The BR@@ 1 also provides substantial inputs to the lateral part of the BR@@ 2 , a component of the rostral behavioral control column involved in the expression of mascul@@ ine sexual behavior , and to the anterior hypothalamic nucleus , a component involved in the expression of defensive behavior .
The most obvious component here is the BR@@ 1 , which , along with the interconnected BR@@ 2 and substantia inn@@ om@@ in@@ ata , has been implicated in the control of locomotor behavior and reward expectation ( see Sw@@ an@@ son et al , 1984 ; M@@ ogen@@ son et al , 1985 ; M@@ ogen@@ son , 1987 ; Wilson et al , 1995 ; Gro@@ ene@@ we@@ gen et al , 1996 ; I@@ k@@ emo@@ to and P@@ ank@@ sep@@ p , 1999 ; Kel@@ ley , 1999 ; Parkinson et al , 1999 ; T@@ z@@ sch@@ ent@@ ke and Sch@@ mid@@ t , 2000 ; Re@@ yn@@ olds and B@@ err@@ id@@ ge , 2002 ; W@@ ise , 2002 ) .
In contrast to the B@@ ST anterolateral group , the BR@@ 1 projects substantially to the BR@@ 2 of the epith@@ al@@ am@@ us , especially to its caudal end .
First , the hypothalamic BR@@ 1 receives a dense BR@@ 2 input .
Fourth , the caudal BR@@ 1 receives a substantial input from the BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 inputs to the BR@@ 2 were reported in the retrograde tracer study of Li and colleagues ( 1993 ) .
Functional implications : neural inputs Frag@@ mentary structural evidence suggests that the BR@@ 1 receives direct neural inputs from the BR@@ 2 and cerebral nuclei ( stri@@ at@@ op@@ all@@ idum ) , brainstem viscer@@ osensory nuclei , and brainstem regions related to behavioral state control ( Fig 11 ) .
The BR@@ 1 receives a major input from the anter@@ odorsal part of the BR@@ 2
For the same reason , projections from the BR@@ 1 to other parts of the BR@@ 2 ( nucleus accumbens and lateral septal nucleus ) and pallidum ( substantia inn@@ om@@ in@@ ata ) and to the behavioral state system ( especially the supram@@ am@@ m@@ illary and tuber@@ om@@ am@@ m@@ illary nuclei ) also are not illustrated .
For the same reason , projections from the BR@@ 1 to other parts of the striatum ( BR@@ 2 and lateral septal nucleus ) and pallidum ( substantia inn@@ om@@ in@@ ata ) and to the behavioral state system ( especially the supram@@ am@@ m@@ illary and tuber@@ om@@ am@@ m@@ illary nuclei ) also are not illustrated .

This is interesting in light of its projections to the BR@@ 1 , which in turn projects to the BR@@ 2 and region of the lamina terminalis ( Fig 11 ) .
The BR@@ 1 is also innervated moderately by ventral regions of the capsular part of the BR@@ 2 and lightly by its medial part ( D@@ ong et al , 200@@ 1a ) .
In addition , the BR@@ 1 is innervated by the BR@@ 2 rhom@@ boid nucleus ( D@@ ong and Sw@@ an@@ son , 2003 ) and caudal substantia inn@@ om@@ in@@ ata ( Gro@@ ve , 198@@ 8a ) , both of which receive inputs from the central amygdal@@ ar nucleus ( Gro@@ ve , 198@@ 8@@ b ; Su@@ n and C@@ ass@@ ell , 1993 ; D@@ ong and Sw@@ an@@ son , 2003 ) .
In addition , the BR@@ 1 is innervated by the B@@ ST BR@@ 2 ( D@@ ong and Sw@@ an@@ son , 2003 ) and caudal substantia inn@@ om@@ in@@ ata ( Gro@@ ve , 198@@ 8a ) , both of which receive inputs from the central amygdal@@ ar nucleus ( Gro@@ ve , 198@@ 8@@ b ; Su@@ n and C@@ ass@@ ell , 1993 ; D@@ ong and Sw@@ an@@ son , 2003 ) .
It seems likely that the BR@@ 1 receives direct inputs from the BR@@ 2 ( Ric@@ ar@@ do and K@@ o , 1978 ) and central part of the lateral division of the par@@ abr@@ achial nucleus ( Al@@ den et al , 1994 ) .
It seems likely that the BR@@ 1 receives direct inputs from the nucleus of the solitary tract ( Ric@@ ar@@ do and K@@ o , 1978 ) and central part of the lateral division of the BR@@ 2 ( Al@@ den et al , 1994 ) .
Rec@@ all that the same part of the BR@@ 1 receives an input from the BR@@ 2 .
The BR@@ 1 also projects to the region of the BR@@ 2 / median preoptic nucleus , which projects back massi@@ vely to the B@@ ST@@ d@@ m ( Th@@ omp@@ son and Sw@@ an@@ son , 2003 ) .
The B@@ ST@@ d@@ m also projects to the region of the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis / BR@@ 1 , which projects back massi@@ vely to the BR@@ 2 ( Th@@ omp@@ son and Sw@@ an@@ son , 2003 ) .
Available h@@ od@@ ological data on input from the BR@@ 1 and output to the BR@@ 2 ( K@@ ra@@ y@@ ni@@ ak and Si@@ eg@@ el , 19@@ 78@@ b ; A@@ to@@ ji et al , 2002 ) suggest homology of the medial septal nucleus of birds with the nucleus of the same name in mammals .
In the present study , anterograde tracer injections in the BR@@ 1 resulted in terminal @-@ like labeling in the per@@ ir@@ h@@ inal cortex and the dorsal end@@ opyr@@ iform nucleus , the hippocampus , the medial septum diagonal band complex , lateral and triangular septum medial amygdala , the intral@@ amin@@ ar thalamic nuclei , and the BR@@ 2 .
These data led us to conclude that there is a system of ascending projections arising from the BR@@ 1 to the median raphe , mamm@@ illary complex , BR@@ 2 , lateral hab@@ en@@ ula , nucleus re@@ uni@@ ens , amygdala , entorhinal cortex , medial septum , and hippocampus .
These data led us to conclude that there is a system of ascending projections arising from the BR@@ 1 to the median raphe , mamm@@ illary complex , hypothalamus , BR@@ 2 , nucleus re@@ uni@@ ens , amygdala , entorhinal cortex , medial septum , and hippocampus .
Lab@@ eled fibers to dorsal BR@@ 1 areas arose from labeled fibers in the BR@@ 2 .
In addition , injections of D &#91; 3H &#93; aspartate into the BR@@ 1 resulted in retrograde labeling in what B@@ ear@@ t et al ( 1990 , Fig@@ s 2 , 9 . 3 ) called the central gray BR@@ 2 , which corresponds to the NI .
Basic organization of the hypothalamus The majority of connections within the adult forebrain are accounted for by a familiar qualitative scheme : the dorsal BR@@ 1 projects top@@ ographically to the entire BR@@ 2 ( see &#91; 267 &#93; ) , which in turn projects top@@ ographically to the basal ganglia , especially the striatum ( see &#91; 84 &#93; ) .
The overall organization of projections from the various thalamic nuclei to the entire cortical mantle is also firmly established , along with the organizing principles of outputs from the whole BR@@ 1 ( neocortex ) to the classical basal ganglia ( BR@@ 2 ) .
Furthermore , it is proposed that there is a basic scheme of inter@@ connections between the BR@@ 1 , BR@@ 2 , and pallidum , with differenti@@ ations or special@@ izations of this prototypical circuit element in various morphologically and functionally distinct regions of the cerebral hemispheres .

It is also similar in principle to the caud@@ ally adjacent reticular part of the substantia nigra &#91; 39 , 226 &#93; , which s@@ ends a branched projection to the brainstem motor system ( including the deeper layers of the superior colliculus and reticular formation ) and to the thalamus &#91; 16 , 266 &#93; ; and it is similar to the adjacent BR@@ 1 , which s@@ ends projections to the BR@@ 2 motor system and thalamus , in addition to other sites ( see &#91; 17 , 273 &#93; ) .

This information is rel@@ ayed , at least in part , by direct connections from the nucleus of the solitary tract o the PV@@ H@@ d , and by less direct inputs rel@@ ayed from the BR@@ 1 via the ventrolateral BR@@ 2 ( the lateral parag@@ ig@@ ant@@ ocellular reticular nucleus ) , projections to the PV@@ H@@ d that in part use norepinephrine , epinephrine , galanin , and neuropeptide Y as neurotransmitters &#91; 148 , 239 , 240 &#93; .

The adult minimal or prototypical circuit element ( Fig 14 ) consists of : ( 1 ) an excitatory ( glutamatergic ) projection from cortex to the brainstem and spinal cord motor system , with an excitatory collateral &#91; 146 &#93; to the striatum ; ( 2 ) an inhibitory ( GABAergic ) projection from the BR@@ 1 to the brainstem motor system , with an inhibitory collateral &#91; 197 &#93; to the BR@@ 2 ; and ( 3 ) an inhibitory ( GABAergic ) projection from the pallidum to the brainstem motor system ( with an inhibitory collateral &#91; 197 &#93; to the thalamus ) .
The adult minimal or prototypical circuit element ( Fig 14 ) consists of : ( 1 ) an excitatory ( glutamatergic ) projection from cortex to the brainstem and spinal cord motor system , with an excitatory collateral &#91; 146 &#93; to the striatum ; ( 2 ) an inhibitory ( GABAergic ) projection from the striatum to the brainstem motor system , with an inhibitory collateral &#91; 197 &#93; to the pallidum ; and ( 3 ) an inhibitory ( GABAergic ) projection from the BR@@ 1 to the brainstem motor system ( with an inhibitory collateral &#91; 197 &#93; to the BR@@ 2 ) .
The descending projection to the brainstem / spinal cord motor system from the BR@@ 1 ( synonymous with neocortex , a term better left un@@ used in light of un@@ founded evolutionary implications ; see Section 6 ) arises primarily from layer 5 , whereas the is@@ ocortical projection to BR@@ 2 arises predominantly from layer 6 ; cortical associ@@ ational / commissural projections arise preferentially from suprag@@ ran@@ ular layers 2 and 3 ( see Fig 13 .
The BR@@ 1 then generates a GABAergic projection to the motor system , with a GABAergic collateral to the BR@@ 2 .
Finally , the BR@@ 1 generates a GABAergic projection to the brainstem motor system , with a GABAergic collateral to the dorsal BR@@ 2 .
According to this now widely accepted view , the caudate nucleus and putamen form the dorsal BR@@ 1 , which projects to the globus pallidus or dorsal BR@@ 2 ; whereas in contrast the nucleus accumbens , striatal fundus , and olfactory tubercle form the ventral striatum , which projects to the substantia inn@@ om@@ in@@ ata or ventral pallidum broadly conceived .

the striatum for hippocampal cortex It is now known that there is a top@@ ographically organized projection from A@@ mm@@ ons horn cortex and BR@@ 1 proper to the BR@@ 2 ( Section 4 ) , that the medium spiny neurons there are GABAergic ( as in the dorsal and ventral striatum ) , and that there is a projection from the lateral septal nucleus to the medial septal / nucleus of the diagonal band complex It seems obvious that the latter , with its mixture of GABAergic and cholinergic neurons is a medial differentiation of the substantia inn@@ om@@ in@@ ata that is specialized with respect to connections with the hippocampal formation &#91; 124 , 169 , 232 &#93; .
A top@@ ographically organized projection from most of the BR@@ 1 to the entire BR@@ 2 was first demonstrated in 19@@ 61 by Web@@ ster &#91; 325 &#93; , and since that time it has become clear &#91; 59 , 166 &#93; that major contributors include the visual , auditory , somatosensory , and gustatory areas , the somat@@ omotor areas , the orbital cortex and cingulate region , and posterior parietal and temporal association areas ( Fig 20@@ A ) .
In terms of basal ganglia / cerebral nuclei inputs to the behavior control column , there is a top@@ ographically organized GABAergic projection from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 ( see &#91; 59 &#93; ) , and most of these axons generate a GABAergic collateral in the globus pallidus ( see &#91; 197 &#93; ) -- and then there is a dense GABAergic projection from the globus pallidus ( both segments ) to the substantia nigra &#91; 102 , 262 , 265 , 298 &#93; .

Ax@@ onal projections from the olfactory cortex and immediately adjacent regions that differentiate near the BR@@ 1 / basal ganglia , desc@@ end in the BR@@ 2 ( m@@ f@@ b ) , ventral to the obliter@@ ated lateral ventricle ( BD ) .
This is the basic triple descending projection from the BR@@ 1 to the motor system ( including the behavior control column ) discussed in Section 3 . 2 , and it tends to course through the BR@@ 2 / lateral forebrain bundle fiber system &#91; 282 &#93; ( Fig 20@@ A ) .
Then , the BR@@ 1 s@@ ends dense projections to the BR@@ 2 and to the ventral tegmental area component of the behavior control column &#91; 104 , 105 , 188 , 287 &#93; , projections that are GABAergic ( see &#91; 126 &#93; ) .
Then , the BR@@ 1 s@@ ends dense projections to the substantia inn@@ om@@ in@@ ata and to the BR@@ 2 component of the behavior control column &#91; 104 , 105 , 188 , 287 &#93; , projections that are GABAergic ( see &#91; 126 &#93; ) .
And finally , the BR@@ 1 ( ventral pallidum in the sense of Fig 19 ) s@@ ends a presumably GABAergic projection to the BR@@ 2 , and other brainstem regions ( see &#91; 92 &#93; ) .
To the goal ( rostral ) segment The BR@@ 1 or medial striatum receives a top@@ ographically organized input from fields BR@@ 2 @-@ 3 of A@@ mm@@ ons horn or the hippocampus proper , as well as from the sub@@ icul@@ um proper , via the pre@@ commissural fornix &#91; 225 , 286 , 288 &#93; ( Fig 20@@ D ) .

The BR@@ 1 in turn s@@ ends a descending , presumably GABAergic , projection to the medial septal / diagonal band complex ( medial BR@@ 2 ) and to most components of the rostral behavior control column ( see &#91; 225 , 289 &#93; ) .
Because of the highly topographic nature of projections from the BR@@ 1 to the BR@@ 2 , and from the latter to the behavior control column , it would appear that different dor@@ so@@ ventral zones within the hippocampus ( and in particular field CA1 ) influence different functional components of the behavior control column &#91; 223 , 225 &#93; ( Fig 21 ) .
By far the most dense striatal projection of the BR@@ 1 ( primary pherom@@ onal cortex ) is to the BR@@ 2 &#91; 242 &#93; , which also receives massive inputs from areas of cortex associated with the amygdala ( cortical nucleus and post@@ pir@@ iform transition and pir@@ iform @-@ amygdal@@ ar areas ) ( see &#91; 162 , 165 &#93; ) -- all of which in turn receive massive inputs from the main or accessory olfactory bulb &#91; 242 &#93; .
Per@@ haps the most dense striatal projections from the visceral area and adjacent posterior BR@@ 1 are to the central nucleus , which also gets heavy inputs from the amygdala @-@ related cortical regions just mentioned as projecting massi@@ vely to the BR@@ 2 ( see &#91; 162 , 165 &#93; ) .
The BR@@ 1 , and three principal cortical recipients of its output , the BR@@ 2 , ten@@ ia tec@@ ta , and pir@@ iform area ( see &#91; 208 , 241 &#93; ) , all project heavily to an unusual differentiation of the ( ventral ) striatum , the olfactory tubercle ( see &#91; 98 , 152 , 208 &#93; ) .
The BR@@ 1 , and three principal cortical recipients of its output , the anterior olfactory nucleus , ten@@ ia tec@@ ta , and BR@@ 2 ( see &#91; 208 , 241 &#93; ) , all project heavily to an unusual differentiation of the ( ventral ) striatum , the olfactory tubercle ( see &#91; 98 , 152 , 208 &#93; ) .
The BR@@ 1 does not project outside the cerebral hemispheres ; and at best the only brainstem projections of the BR@@ 2 , ten@@ ia tec@@ ta , and pir@@ iform area consist of light inputs to the caudal lateral hypothalamic area ( see &#91; 210 &#93; ) , and to the central part of the thalamic medi@@ odorsal nucleus ( from the pir@@ iform area ) &#91; 210 &#93; .

The BR@@ 1 part of the ventral striatum has only one major projection -- to the immediately underlying BR@@ 2 &#91; 152 &#93; , although there is a lighter projection to the caudal lateral hypothalamic area from layer 3 &#91; 210 &#93; .

The hippocampal cortex ( A@@ mm@@ ons horn and BR@@ 1 proper ) projects top@@ ographically upon the BR@@ 2 ( medial striatum ) , which in turn projects top@@ ographically upon the hypothalamus , including the rostral behavior control column ( also see Fig 20@@ D ) .

In contrast , field BR@@ 1 and the sub@@ icul@@ um ( BR@@ 2 ) project preferentially to the rostral lateral septal nucleus ( LS@@ r ) , which in turn projects top@@ ographically to the behavior control column .
In contrast , field BR@@ 1 and the sub@@ icul@@ um ( SU@@ B ) project preferentially to the rostral lateral septal nucleus ( BR@@ 2 ) , which in turn projects top@@ ographically to the behavior control column .
In contrast , field CA1 and the BR@@ 1 ( SU@@ B ) project preferentially to the rostral BR@@ 2 ( LS@@ r ) , which in turn projects top@@ ographically to the behavior control column .
For example , zone 2 in field BR@@ 1 / SU@@ B projects to a restricted region of the BR@@ 2 ( rostral section through the SE@@ PT@@ UM , upper left ) , which in turn projects preferentially to the anterior hypothalamic nucleus ( A@@ HN ) , part of the defensive behavior control sub@@ system ( Fig 12 ) .

The precise region of BR@@ 1 ( substantia inn@@ om@@ in@@ ata ) receiving input from the BR@@ 2 has not been analyzed with modern anterograde tracing methods ; presumably it s@@ ends descending GABAergic fibers through the medial forebrain bundle .

In addition , the BR@@ 1 s@@ ends a light projection to the BR@@ 2 &#91; 62 &#93; .
Furthermore , the external BR@@ 1 projects locally to the internal globus pallidus &#91; 131 &#93; and BR@@ 2 &#91; 212 , 265 &#93; , as well as to the cerebral cortex &#91; 232 , 236 &#93; .

In the rat BR@@ 1 , the internal globus pallidus innerv@@ ates adjacent regions of the ventral anteri@@ or@@ lateral complex and ventral medial nucleus &#91; 43 , 313 &#93; , the parac@@ entral and paraf@@ asc@@ icular nuclei of the intral@@ amin@@ ar group &#91; 298 &#93; , and the BR@@ 2 &#91; 200 , 298 &#93; .

At a high level of resolution , studies of individual bar@@ rels in the vi@@ b@@ ris@@ sal region of the rat BR@@ 1 demonstrate that a single cortical column s@@ ends divergent projections to multiple regions of the BR@@ 2 &#91; 6 &#93; , and it has even been shown that a single barrel generates two types of only partly overlapping terminal fields within the caud@@ op@@ ut@@ amen -- one diffuse and the other discrete &#91; 335 &#93; .
For instance , the BR@@ 1 ( PL ) of the medial prefrontal cortex projects to the dorsal , ventral , medial , and caudal BR@@ 2 ( Fig 23@@ B ) as defined on regional grounds in Fig 19 .
For instance , the prelim@@ bic area ( BR@@ 1 ) of the medial prefrontal cortex projects to the dorsal , ventral , medial , and caudal BR@@ 2 ( Fig 23@@ B ) as defined on regional grounds in Fig 19 .

Finally , each of the six major regions of the BR@@ 1 identified here projects more or less densely to one or more regions of the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 29 ) .
In fact , it seems likely that most if not all of the BR@@ 1 receives at least some input from the BR@@ 2 .
Con@@ fin@@ ing the discussion to rats , the anatomical evidence demonstrates that each of the six major regions of the BR@@ 1 identified here projects to both the dorsal and ventral BR@@ 2 .
Overall , the BR@@ 1 innerv@@ ates at least seven nuclei in the dorsal BR@@ 2 ( Fig 30 ) and two in the ventral thalamus .
As far as the latter are concerned , all regions of the BR@@ 1 except the external globus pallidus are known to innervate substantially the BR@@ 2 , and the external pallidum and substantia inn@@ om@@ in@@ ata project to the reticular nucleus ( see references in Fig 30 ) .

( B ) Ess@@ entially the entire stri@@ at@@ op@@ all@@ idum ( BR@@ 1 / basal ganglia ) generates a branched projection to the dorsal BR@@ 2 and behavioral control column , which in turn generates a branched projection to the dorsal BR@@ 2 and brainstem motor system .
The parts of the BR@@ 1 innervated by the BR@@ 2 and behavior control column are indicated in pink .

For example , primary visual and primary BR@@ 1 of cortex , which have very different functions , both project to the dorsal BR@@ 2 ( caud@@ op@@ ut@@ amen ) , whereas the ventral striatum has been defined as containing such morphologically and functionally diverse components as the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle .

The BR@@ 1 ( CEA ) projects to the caudal BR@@ 2 and brainstem nuclei associated with the autonomic system ( not shown ) .
The central amygdal@@ ar nucleus ( BR@@ 1 ) projects to the caudal BR@@ 2 and brainstem nuclei associated with the autonomic system ( not shown ) .
The function of the lateral zone of the hypothalamus is less clear , but it is probably involved in the control of behavioral state and levels of arousal . The medial BR@@ 1 receives inputs from the cerebral hemispheres , as well as from the various sensory systems &#91; 226 &#93; and the state control system ( the BR@@ 2 is just one example &#91; 324 &#93; ) .
The reticular BR@@ 1 projects to most of these areas , as well as to the external and dorsal BR@@ 2 , red nucleus , and a nearby oculomotor @-@ related cell group , the medial accessory nucleus ( Fig 2@@ 2D ) .
The reticular BR@@ 1 projects to most of these areas , as well as to the external and dorsal inferior colliculus , BR@@ 2 , and a nearby oculomotor @-@ related cell group , the medial accessory nucleus ( Fig 2@@ 2D ) .
The BR@@ 1 and ventr@@ ally adjacent posterior agran@@ ular insular area of cortex project massi@@ vely to the BR@@ 2 of the caudal striatum ( Section 4 . 2 ) , and it in turn has direct projections to components of the brainstem autonomic system , including preganglionic parasympathetic cell groups &#91; 117 &#93; .

However , the BR@@ 1 &#91; 38 &#93; of the caudal striatum , and the infr@@ alim@@ bic &#91; 119 &#93; , ventral sub@@ icular &#91; 40 &#93; , and posterior amygdal@@ ar &#91; 35 &#93; regions of cortex also project substantially to the ventral lateral septum / anterior bed nuclei , as well as directly to the viscer@@ omotor pattern generator network in the BR@@ 2 of the hypothalamus .
The green a indicates the BR@@ 1 , which arises from layer 5 pyramidal cells , and s@@ ends a collateral to the BR@@ 2 ( near L ) , whereas the green b indicates the cortico@@ thalamic projection , which arises mainly from layer 6 pyramidal cells .
In particular , the BR@@ 1 receives inputs from all parts of the central nucleus ( but not medial nucleus ) and from the BR@@ 2 , anterior bas@@ omedial nucleus , posterior basolateral nucleus , and post@@ pir@@ iform transition area ( D@@ ong et al , 200@@ 1a ) .
In particular , the BR@@ 1 receives inputs from all parts of the central nucleus ( but not medial nucleus ) and from the anterior area , anterior bas@@ omedial nucleus , posterior basolateral nucleus , and BR@@ 2 ( D@@ ong et al , 200@@ 1a ) .
After the rostr@@ ally directed fibers just described leave the BR@@ 1 , they provide dense inputs to ventral stri@@ at@@ op@@ all@@ idal regions of the basal ganglia / BR@@ 2 , as well as light inputs to the lateral septal complex and medial prefrontal cortex ( Fig 3 ) .
After the rostr@@ ally directed fibers just described leave the BR@@ 1 , they provide dense inputs to ventral stri@@ at@@ op@@ all@@ idal regions of the basal ganglia / cerebral nuclei , as well as light inputs to the BR@@ 2 and medial prefrontal cortex ( Fig 3 ) .
Upon leaving the BR@@ 1 these fibers enter the caudal end of the BR@@ 2 , where they branch infrequently but generate abundant terminal boutons and boutons @-@ of@@ passage ( Fig@@ s 4E , 5A ) .
More rostr@@ ally , dor@@ s@@ ally , and laterally , innervation of the BR@@ 1 by the BR@@ 2 decreases very substantially ( Fig 4C , D ) .
The BR@@ 1 generates very complex intra @-@ BR@@ 2 connections .
A distinct bundle of PH@@ AL @-@ labeled axons clim@@ bs dor@@ s@@ ally from injection sites in the BR@@ 1 to enter the BR@@ 2 and follow it to the amygdal@@ ar region ( Fig 4@@ IK ) .
In addition , a few axons from the BR@@ 1 extend through the BR@@ 2 into the lateral segment of the globus pallidus , where they extend caud@@ ally to join the an@@ sa pedunc@@ ularis ( Fig 4@@ IL ) .
In addition , a few axons from the BR@@ 1 extend through the internal capsule into the lateral segment of the globus pallidus , where they extend caud@@ ally to join the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ IL ) .
Thus , a dense , un@@ interrupted terminal field generated by the BR@@ 1 is observed in the restricted longitudinal zone of the BR@@ 2 illustrated in Fig@@ ures 4@@ EM and 6A .
A tremendous number of axons from the BR@@ 1 enter the BR@@ 2 from the caudal substantia inn@@ om@@ in@@ ata ( Fig@@ s 4@@ L , M , 6A ) , in addition to those entering the caudal end of the nucleus from the stria terminalis ( Fig 4@@ O , P ) .
A tremendous number of axons from the B@@ ST@@ r@@ h enter the BR@@ 1 from the caudal BR@@ 2 ( Fig@@ s 4@@ L , M , 6A ) , in addition to those entering the caudal end of the nucleus from the stria terminalis ( Fig 4@@ O , P ) .
BR@@ 1 axons may also reach the latter via the BR@@ 2 .
BR@@ 1 inputs to BR@@ 2 .
As described in the preceding section , the massive descending bundle of BR@@ 1 axons in the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ K ) spl@@ its at the level of the anterior hypothalamic nucleus into one branch that extends laterally through the an@@ sa pedunc@@ ularis to the amygdal@@ ar region and another branch that travel@@ s caud@@ ally through the medial forebrain bundle ( Fig 4@@ L ) .
Just caudal to the paraventricular nucleus many labeled fibers from the BR@@ 1 extend medi@@ ally from the medial forebrain bundle to innervate densely a restricted dorsal region of the per@@ ifor@@ n@@ ical BR@@ 2 , essentially between the zona inc@@ er@@ ta and fornix ( Fig@@ s 4@@ O , P , 7@@ C ) .
Finally , the BR@@ 1 generates a small pathway that goes directly to the BR@@ 2 of the hypothalamus ( Fig 3 ) .
Finally , the BR@@ 1 generates a small pathway that goes directly to the periventricular zone of the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 3 ) .
A few rostr@@ ally directed axons from the BR@@ 1 leave the rostral end of the B@@ ST to course medi@@ ally through the nucleus of the diagonal band , and lateral and medial preoptic areas , to generate a few terminals in the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis ( Fig 4@@ F ) and BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4G , H ) .
A few rostr@@ ally directed axons from the B@@ ST@@ r@@ h leave the rostral end of the BR@@ 1 to course medi@@ ally through the nucleus of the diagonal band , and lateral and medial preoptic areas , to generate a few terminals in the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ F ) and anter@@ o@@ ventral periventricular nucleus ( Fig 4G , H ) .
However , most of the fibers in the ventral periventricular pathway extend directly medial from the BR@@ 1 , initially through adjacent cell groups of the B@@ ST , and then just ventral to the crossing of the anterior commissure in the roof of the medial preoptic 4@@ 57 area ( Fig@@ s 2A , 4@@ I , J ) , to enter the BR@@ 2 at this level .
BR@@ 1 inputs to BR@@ 2 .
Finally , a small group of axons from the BR@@ 1 appears to follow a somewhat odd pathway to the BR@@ 2 .
These fibers enter the BR@@ 1 through the medial forebrain bundle and in the ventral tegmental area extend laterally and dor@@ s@@ ally between the medial lem@@ n@@ is@@ cus and substantia nigra to enter the par@@ vic@@ ellular part of the thalamic BR@@ 2 , where they generate a few boutons ( Fig 4@@ U , V ) .
The nucleus re@@ uni@@ ens , peri@@ re@@ uni@@ ens nucleus , BR@@ 1 , and central medial nucleus also receive moderate inputs from the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ MT ) , whereas only a few PH@@ AL @-@ labeled axons with terminal boutons were observed in the lateral hab@@ en@@ ula ( Fig 4@@ Q , R ) .
The nucleus re@@ uni@@ ens , peri@@ re@@ uni@@ ens nucleus , rhom@@ boid nucleus , and BR@@ 1 also receive moderate inputs from the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ MT ) , whereas only a few PH@@ AL @-@ labeled axons with terminal boutons were observed in the lateral hab@@ en@@ ula ( Fig 4@@ Q , R ) .

BR@@ 1 inputs to BR@@ 2 and hindbrain .
BR@@ 1 inputs to midbrain and BR@@ 2 .
In the rostral BR@@ 1 , labeled axons from the BR@@ 2 are concentrated in an intermediate zone of the ro@@ stro@@ medial division ( Fig 4@@ U ) , where they branch and generate moderate numbers of boutons , whereas most of the descending fibers appear to course through the medial division and immediately adjacent regions .
A few axons labeled from the BR@@ 1 extend dor@@ s@@ ally from the periaqueductal gray to enter the deep and intermediate gray layers of the overlying BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ V@@ Z ) .
As labeled BR@@ 1 axons in the medial forebrain bundle course through the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ UW ) they generate considerable boutons ( and thus a terminal field ) and divide into two substantial branches , the smaller forming a median pathway and the much larger forming a lateral pathway .
Along the ro@@ stro@@ caudal extent of the ventral tegmental area , PH@@ AL @-@ labeled axons from the BR@@ 1 extend medi@@ ally to enter the raphe nuclei and then continue dor@@ s@@ ally and caud@@ ally toward the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ V@@ AA ) .
The vast majority of BR@@ 1 axons in the medial forebrain bundle course laterally from the ventral tegmental area , although a relatively small number extend through the floor of the BR@@ 2 , in what is the most direct descending route for the medial forebrain bundle to the medulla and spinal cord ( Fig 3 ) .
The vast majority of BR@@ 1 axons in the medial forebrain bundle course laterally from the ventral tegmental area , although a relatively small number extend through the floor of the pontine reticular nucleus , in what is the most direct descending route for the medial forebrain bundle to the BR@@ 2 and spinal cord ( Fig 3 ) .
The vast majority of B@@ ST@@ r@@ h axons in the BR@@ 1 course laterally from the ventral tegmental area , although a relatively small number extend through the floor of the BR@@ 2 , in what is the most direct descending route for the BR@@ 1 to the medulla and spinal cord ( Fig 3 ) .
First , many PH@@ AL @-@ labeled axons from the BR@@ 1 course dorsome@@ di@@ ally into the BR@@ 2 , where they generate a very dense terminal field in the ventrolateral division ( Fig@@ s 4@@ Y@@ CC , 7@@ E ) , and light terminal fields in the dorsal , dorsolateral , and other divisions .
The caud@@ olateral tip of the BR@@ 1 receives a modest input from the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ C@@ CDD ) ; the par@@ abr@@ achial and pontine reticular nuclei will be discussed shortly .
One restricted region of the BR@@ 1 in particular receives a massive input from the BR@@ 2 : it is centered between the root of the trochle@@ ar nerve and the later@@ odorsal tegmental nucleus near the rostral tip of the locus coeruleus ( Fig 4@@ DD , EE ) .
By far the largest terminal field generated by this caud@@ ally directed BR@@ 1 ( see Fig 3 ) of the lateral pathway is centered in the BR@@ 2 , and is established by fibers that course dorsal to , ventral to , and trans@@ versely through the superior cerebellar ped@@ un@@ cle ( Fig@@ s 4@@ CC@@ GG , 7@@ F ) .
Par@@ ts of the BR@@ 1 and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve receive an extremely dense input from the BR@@ 2 , with the fibers arri@@ ving from the underlying par@@ vic@@ ellular reticular nucleus , as well , undoubtedly , as from areas of the reticular formation ventral to it ( Fig@@ s 4@@ LL@@ Q@@ Q , 8A ) .
Par@@ ts of the nucleus of the solitary tract and BR@@ 1 receive an extremely dense input from the BR@@ 2 , with the fibers arri@@ ving from the underlying par@@ vic@@ ellular reticular nucleus , as well , undoubtedly , as from areas of the reticular formation ventral to it ( Fig@@ s 4@@ LL@@ Q@@ Q , 8A ) .
There is an interesting terminal field from the BR@@ 1 in the BR@@ 2 ( Fig 4@@ OO U@@ U ) .
As the medulla approaches the spinal cord , descending BR@@ 1 axons in the par@@ vic@@ ellular reticular nucleus enter the BR@@ 2 , where they display terminal boutons and boutons @-@ of @-@ passage in both the dorsal and ventral parts ( Fig 4@@ Q@@ Q@@ TT ) .
In the caudal inter@@ brain , a small number of ipsilateral BR@@ 1 axons cross the midline in the BR@@ 2 to enter the contralateral BR@@ 2 and then desc@@ end to the periaqueductal gray and pontine central gray ( Fig 4@@ T@@ U ) .
Some labeled axons from the BR@@ 1 cross the midline in the commissural part of the BR@@ 2 to enter the contralateral BR@@ 2 and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve .
Some labeled axons from the BR@@ 1 cross the midline in the commissural part of the nucleus of the solitary tract to enter the contralateral nucleus of the solitary tract and BR@@ 2 .
Sev@@ enth , whereas all three BR@@ 1 regions appear to send inputs to the BR@@ 2 , only the B@@ ST@@ r@@ h Control injections First , it is worth re@@ iter@@ ating that there are three other distinct cell groups embedded within undifferentiated regions of the anterolateral BR@@ 1 are@@ a@@ --the jux@@ tac@@ apsular , oval , and fusiform nucle@@ i@@ --and that the projections of each are distinct and characteristic , and are also different from those of the surrounding anterolateral area and sub@@ com@@ - 4@@ 62 H @-@ W D@@ ON@@ G AND LW SW@@ AN@@ SON Fig 9 .

Fluoro@@ gold injections in the caudal BR@@ 1 retrogradely label neurons in all major subdivisions of the BR@@ 2 , including the B@@ ST@@ r@@ h ( Bro@@ g et al , 1993 ) , and cholera toxin injected into the striatal fundus , in the region of the medial interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure , also retrogradely label neurons in the general region of the BR@@ 2 that includes the B@@ ST@@ r@@ h ( Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h @-@ Lag@@ n@@ ado et al , 1999 ) .
In@@ dex@@ ing terms : prefrontal cortex ; hippocampus ; hypothalamus ; amygdala ; theta rhythm The nucleus re@@ uni@@ ens ( BR@@ 1 ) is the largest of the midline nuclei of the thalamus and is the major source of thalamic afferents to the BR@@ 2 and para@@ hippocampal structures , including the entorhinal cortex ( W@@ ou@@ ter@@ lo@@ od et al , 1990 ; W@@ ou@@ ter@@ lo@@ od , 1991 ) .
&quot; This thalam@@ o@@ hippocampal connection bypasses the tris@@ ynaptic / commissural pathway that has been thought to be the exclusive excitatory drive to CA1 . &quot; &quot; Although BR@@ 1 is a major input to the BR@@ 2 ( HF ) and one of the few direct routes to HF , very few studies have examined afferent projections to RE in Gr@@ ant spon@@ sor : National Institute of Mental Health ; Gr@@ ant number : MH@@ 6@@ 35@@ 19 ; Gr@@ ant number : MH@@ 0@@ 14@@ 76 . &quot;
