To investigate the electrophysiological properties, synaptic connections, and anatomy of individual parvalbumin-immunoreactive (PV-IR) and cholecystokinin-immunoreactive (CCK-IR) interneurones in <BrainRegion1>CA1</BrainRegion1>, dual intracellular recordings using biocytin-filled microelectrodes in slices of adult rat <BrainRegion2>hippocampus</BrainRegion2> were combined with fluorescence labelling of PV- and CCK-containing cells
1
The present study was undertaken to establish the precise anatomical relationship of the <BrainRegion1>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion1> (STh) with <BrainRegion2>limbic lobe-afferented parts of the basal ganglia</BrainRegion2> in the rat
0
 The results of these tracing experiments confirm the general notion of reciprocal connections between the <BrainRegion1>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion1>(STh) and <BrainRegion2>pallidal areas</BrainRegion2>
1
 The reciprocal projection from this <BrainRegion1>pallidal area</BrainRegion1> to <BrainRegion2>subthalamic regions</BrainRegion2> appears to be very sparse
0
 The <BrainRegion1>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion1> sends a very sparse projection back to the <BrainRegion2>medial subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion2>(STh) 
1
 The projections of the <BrainRegion1>medial subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion1>(STh) to the <BrainRegion2>ventral mesencephalon</BrainRegion2> appear also to be topographically organized
1
 In addition, a number of <BrainRegion1>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion1>(STh) fibers reach the midbrain <BrainRegion2>extrapyramidal area</BrainRegion2>
1
 These findings suggest a role for the <BrainRegion1>subthalamic nucleus</BrainRegion1>(STh) in nonmotor functions of the <BrainRegion2>basal ganglia</BrainRegion2>
0
 The midbrain <BrainRegion1>nucleus raphe dorsalis</BrainRegion1> was the major site of origin for neurons providing a serotoninergic projection to the <BrainRegion2>ventral posterolateral nucleus</BrainRegion2>
1
The areal and laminar distributions of the projection from the <BrainRegion1>parvocellular part of laminae C of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion1> (Cparv) were studied in <BrainRegion2>visual cortical areas</BrainRegion2> of the cat with the anterograde tracing method by using wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase
0
 In <BrainRegion1>areas 18</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>19</BrainRegion2>, the projection fibers terminate in the superficial half of layer I and in the full portions of layers III and IV, forming double bands
0
 The present results demonstrate that the <BrainRegion1>Cparv</BrainRegion1> fibers terminate in a localized fashion in both the <BrainRegion2>striate and the extrastriate cortical areas</BrainRegion2> and that these W-cell projections are quite unique in their areal and laminar organization compared with the X- and Y-cell systems
1
During the pharyngeal phase of the swallowing reflex, the <BrainRegion1>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion1> (NTS) receives peripheral inputs from the pharynx by means of the <BrainRegion2>glossopharyngeal ganglion</BrainRegion2> and is the location of premotor neurons for the pharyngeal (PH) motoneurons
1
 We investigated whether the neurons in the <BrainRegion1>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion1>(NTS) projected directly to the pharyngeal(PH) motoneurons or to the other kinds of neurons in the <BrainRegion2>ambiguus</BrainRegion2>(AmS) by using the electron microscope
0
 Although labelled fibers from these injections were seen throughout the brain, the region of the <BrainRegion1>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion2> (NTS) were most conspicuous in also having corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) immunoreactive fibers
0
 These results strongly suggest that the <BrainRegion1>corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area</BrainRegion1>(LHA) activated by cellular dehydration provide an input to the region of the <BrainRegion2>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion2>
1
The <BrainRegion1>interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure</BrainRegion1> (IPAC) lies at the junction of the striatopallidal system and the <BrainRegion2>lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis-central amygdaloid nucleus continuum</BrainRegion2> (i
0
 Local connections are found within <BrainRegion1>medial IPAC</BrainRegion1> and within <BrainRegion2>lateral IPAC</BrainRegion2>, but the two divisions are not interconnected
0
 Labeling of sensory vagal projections was also found in the <BrainRegion1>area postrema</BrainRegion1> of both sides and around neurons of the <BrainRegion2>dmnX</BrainRegion2>
1
The <BrainRegion1>ventral striatum</BrainRegion1> mediates goal-directed behavior through <BrainRegion2>limbic</BrainRegion2> afferents
1
 However, <BrainRegion1>striatal regions caudal to the anterior commissure</BrainRegion1> also receive inputs from the <BrainRegion2>amygdala</BrainRegion2>
1
 There are also <BrainRegion1>amygdaloid</BrainRegion1> inputs to calcium binding protein(CaBP) -positive areas outside the shell, which originate mainly in the <BrainRegion2>basal nucleus</BrainRegion2>
0
 Electron microscopic studies using combined anterograde tracing and pre- and post-embedding immunogold labelling have shown that the pathways originating from the <BrainRegion1>CeA</BrainRegion1> to the <BrainRegion2>NTS</BrainRegion2> are inhibitory and may use GABA as a neurotransmitter
1
 The results of these studies suggest that blood pressure changes produced by activation of the <BrainRegion1>CeA</BrainRegion1> may be mediated by attenuation of baroreceptor reflexes through a GABAergic mechanism at the level of the <BrainRegion2>NTS</BrainRegion2>
0
The <BrainRegion1>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion1> (IGL), homolog of the primate <BrainRegion2>pregeniculate nucleus</BrainRegion2>, modulates circadian rhythms
0
 Here, <BrainRegion1>descending intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion1>(IGL) -efferent pathways are identified with the anterograde tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin, with projections to over 50 <BrainRegion2>brain stem nuclei</BrainRegion2>
1
 The <BrainRegion1>dorsal raphe</BrainRegion1> also receives projections from the <BrainRegion2>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion2>(IGL) and may contribute to both sleep/arousal and visuomotor function
1
The mammalian <BrainRegion1>medial vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion1> (MVe) receives input from all <BrainRegion2>vestibular endorgans</BrainRegion2> and provides extensive projections to the central nervous system
1
We utilised retrograde and anterograde tracing procedures to study the origin and termination of <BrainRegion1>prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion1> (PFC) projections to the <BrainRegion2>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion2> (PAG) in the rat
1
This paper describes the quantitative areal and laminar distribution of identified neuron populations projecting from areas of <BrainRegion1>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion1> (PFC) to <BrainRegion2>subcortical autonomic, motor, and limbic sites</BrainRegion2> in the rat
1
 High-resolution flat-map density distributions of retrogradely labelled neurons indicated that specific <BrainRegion1>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion1>(PFC) regions were differentially involved in the projections studied, with <BrainRegion2>medial (m) prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion2>(PFC) divided into dorsal and ventral sectors
0
 Comparable data for the <BrainRegion1>pretectal olivary nucleus</BrainRegion1>(PON) show that this nucleus plays critical roles in the pupillary light reflex, light-evoked blinks, rapid eye movement sleep triggering, and modulating <BrainRegion2>subcortical nuclei</BrainRegion2> involved in circadian rhythms
1
 Our investigation shows that the primate <BrainRegion1>striatum</BrainRegion1> receives both direct and indirect projections from <BrainRegion2>M1</BrainRegion2>
1
 They divide as they enter the <BrainRegion1>dorsolateral sector of the post-commissural putamen</BrainRegion1>, the so-called <BrainRegion2>sensorimotor striatal territory</BrainRegion2>
0
 The indirect corticostriatal projection derives from a thin collateral emitted within the <BrainRegion1>corona radiata</BrainRegion1> by thick, long-range fibers that descend toward the <BrainRegion2>brainstem</BrainRegion2>
0
 The collateral enters the <BrainRegion1>putamen</BrainRegion1> dorsomedially and remains unbranched until it reaches the <BrainRegion2>dorsolateral sector of the putamen</BrainRegion2>, where it breaks out into two to four axonal branches displaying small and equally spaced varicosities
0
 Both direct and indirect corticostriatal axons branch moderately but occupy vast <BrainRegion1>rostrocaudal striatal territories</BrainRegion1>, where they appear to contact en passant several widely distributed <BrainRegion2>striatal</BrainRegion2> neurons
0
 The 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2(HSD2) neurons do not innervate the <BrainRegion1>ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion1>, a key <BrainRegion2>brainstem</BrainRegion2> autonomic site
0
 Consistent with this, there are direct <BrainRegion1>hippocampal</BrainRegion1> projections to the <BrainRegion2>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion2>(mPFC) 
1
 However, the significance of the latter projection remains unclear because no data are available regarding the <BrainRegion1>rhinal</BrainRegion1> targets of <BrainRegion2>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion2>(mPFC) axons
1
 In these two <BrainRegion1>rhinal fields</BrainRegion1>, <BrainRegion2>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion2>(mPFC) axon terminals only formed asymmetric synapses, typically with gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -immunonegative spines ( approximately 70%) but occasionally with dendritic profiles ( approximately 30%), half of which were gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) immunopositive
0
 In the light of earlier observations, these findings indicate that <BrainRegion1>medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion1>(mPFC) inputs exert mainly excitatory effects in the <BrainRegion2>rhinal cortices</BrainRegion2>, prevalently on principal neurons
0
 The stimulation sites (<BrainRegion1>left superior temporal gyrus</BrainRegion1> [L-STG] and <BrainRegion2>inferior parietal lobe</BrainRegion2> [L-IPL]), modality of targets (visual and auditory), and task (pronunciation and lexical decision) were manipulated independently
0
 The observed double dissociation suggests that the conscious task instruction modulates the stimulus-driven activation of the <BrainRegion1>lateral temporal cortex</BrainRegion1> for lexico-phonological activation and the <BrainRegion2>inferior parietal cortex</BrainRegion2> for spoken word production, and thereby engages a different neural network for generating the appropriate behavioral response
0
 <BrainRegion1>Dorsomedial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion1> might alter neuronal activity in areas such as <BrainRegion2>motor cortex</BrainRegion2> to inhibit temporally inappropriate responses
0
 We then reversibly inactivated <BrainRegion1>dorsomedial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion1> while recording ensemble activity in <BrainRegion2>motor cortex</BrainRegion2>
0
 Inactivation of <BrainRegion1>dorsomedial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion1> reduced delay-related firing, but not response-related firing, in <BrainRegion2>motor cortex</BrainRegion2>
0
 These data suggest that functional interactions between <BrainRegion1>dorsomedial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>motor cortex</BrainRegion2> might serve as a top-down control signal that inhibits inappropriate responding
1
 Patterns of cortical label were related to myeloarchitecture in sections cut parallel to the surface of flattened <BrainRegion1>cortex</BrainRegion1>, and to <BrainRegion2>coronal sections of the thalamus</BrainRegion2> processed for cytochrome oxidase (CO)
0
 <BrainRegion1>Cortical sections</BrainRegion1> revealed a caudorostral series of myelin dense ovals (O1-O4) in <BrainRegion2>area 3b</BrainRegion2> that represent the periodontal receptors of the contralateral teeth, the contralateral tongue, the ipsilateral teeth, and the ipsilateral tongue
0
The <BrainRegion1>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion1> (NAc) is part of a <BrainRegion2>forebrain</BrainRegion2> system implicated in reward, motivation, and learning
0
The greater superficial petrosal (GSP), chorda tympani (CT), and glossopharyngeal (IX) nerves terminate in overlapping patterns in the <BrainRegion1>brainstem</BrainRegion1> in the rat <BrainRegion2>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion2> (NTS)
0
The <BrainRegion1>caudal medial auditory area</BrainRegion1> (CM) has anatomical and physiological features consistent with its role as a first-stage (or "belt") <BrainRegion2>auditory association cortex</BrainRegion2>
0
 A companion paper describes the <BrainRegion1>thalamic</BrainRegion1> connections of <BrainRegion2>caudal medial auditory area</BrainRegion2>(CM) (Hackett et al
1
 As expected, connections with adjacent <BrainRegion1>caudal auditory areas</BrainRegion1> were stronger than connections with <BrainRegion2>rostral areas</BrainRegion2>
0
 Taken together, the findings indicate that <BrainRegion1>caudal medial auditory area</BrainRegion1>(CM) may receive somatosensory input from nearby areas along the <BrainRegion2>fundus of the lateral sulcus</BrainRegion2>
1
 During stimulation of the subthalamic(<BrainRegion1>STN</BrainRegion1>) stimulation at 14-Hz, no change in either the mean firing rate or the discharge pattern of <BrainRegion2>substantia nigra pars reticulata</BrainRegion2>(SNr) neurons was observed
0
 stimulation of the subthalamic(<BrainRegion1>STN</BrainRegion1>) stimulation at 140-Hz decreased the mean firing rate by 64% and the mean duration of bursting mode activity of <BrainRegion2>substantia nigra pars reticulata</BrainRegion2>(SNr) neurons by 70%
0
 The <BrainRegion1>substantia nigra pars reticulata</BrainRegion1>(SNr) residual neuronal activity during 140-Hz stimulation of the subthalamic(<BrainRegion2>STN</BrainRegion2>) stimulation was driven by the stimulation of the subthalamic(STN) stimulation
0
 How the decrease in rate and modification of firing pattern with evoked neuronal activity of <BrainRegion1>substantia nigra pars reticulata</BrainRegion1>(SNr) neurons during high frequency stimulation of the subthalamic(<BrainRegion2>STN</BrainRegion2>) stimulation contribute to the improvement of Parkinsonian motor disability remains to be elucidated

Based on developmental principles and insights from animal research about neuroplasticity in cell assemblies, this article is to propose a view of plasticity that promotes a link between <BrainRegion1>hippocampal</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>prefrontal</BrainRegion2> structure and function
0
 Both the mitotic activity (counting of BrdU-labeled cells) in <BrainRegion1>hippocampal dentatus</BrainRegion1> and the maturation of dopamine fibres (quantitative immunochemistry of mesoprefrontal projection) in the <BrainRegion2>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion2> proved to be a measurable combination for investigating the complex chain of events that relate activity dependent neuroplasticity to normal as well as to pathological maturational processes
0
 In the <BrainRegion1>hippocampal dentatus</BrainRegion1>, where ontogenetic plasticity proved to be preserved by continued neuro- and synaptogenesis, serious damage can be internalized without simultaneous disruption of neural dynamics offering an approach to reverse dysfunctional reorganization in the <BrainRegion2>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion2>

This study investigated the axonal projections of whisker-sensitive cells of the <BrainRegion1>spinal trigeminal subnuclei</BrainRegion1> (<BrainRegion2>SP5</BrainRegion2>) in rat oral, interpolar, and caudal divisions (SP5o, SP5i, and SP5c, respectively)
0
 2) Two types of ascending fibers arise from SP5i: Type I fibers are thick and distribute to the <BrainRegion1>posterior group</BrainRegion1>(Po) and to other regions of the <BrainRegion2>midbrain</BrainRegion2>, i
0
 Type II fibers are thin; branch sparsely in the <BrainRegion1>tectum</BrainRegion1>; and form small-sized, bushy arbors in the <BrainRegion2>ventral posterior medial nucleus</BrainRegion2> (VPM)
0
The distribution of <BrainRegion1>cortical</BrainRegion1> efferent connections to the <BrainRegion2>vestibular nuclei</BrainRegion2> was quantitatively analyzed by means of retrograde axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase, wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase, and Fast Blue in rats
1
The present study describes the efferent projections and terminal distributions within the <BrainRegion1>retrohippocampal region</BrainRegion1> of individual layers of the rat <BrainRegion2>medial entorhinal area</BrainRegion2> (MEA) as studied by the methods of anterograde transport of the lectin Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and retrograde transport of the fluorescent dye Fast Blue (FB)
0
 In this study, <BrainRegion1>intergeniculate leaflet</BrainRegion1>(IGL) and <BrainRegion2>ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion2>(VLG) efferent projections were compared by using anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin and retrograde transport of FluoroGold
0
 In the <BrainRegion1>temporal lobe</BrainRegion1>, retrogradely labeled cells were most numerous in the rostral (polar) portion of the <BrainRegion2>perirhinal cortex</BrainRegion2>
0
 Although retrograde tracers can provide only limited evidence for topography, we nonetheless noted that the density of retrogradely labeled cells in a <BrainRegion1>cortical area</BrainRegion1> reliably depended on the location of the tracer injection in the <BrainRegion2>lateral nucleus</BrainRegion2>
0
 Injections of biotinylated dextran amine and Fluoro-Gold in the <BrainRegion1>ICX</BrainRegion1> retrogradely labelled neurons in layers 8-15 of the <BrainRegion2>ipsilateral optic tectum</BrainRegion2> (OT) that could carry this instructive signal

 This projection was point-to-point and in register with the feed-forward, auditory projection from the <BrainRegion1>ICX</BrainRegion1> to the <BrainRegion2>optic tectum</BrainRegion2>(OT) 
1
 Biocytin injected into the superficial layers of the <BrainRegion1>optic tectum</BrainRegion1>(OT) labelled bouton-laden axons in the <BrainRegion2>ICX</BrainRegion2>
1
 These axons were generally finer than, but had similar bouton densities as, feed-forward auditory fibers in the <BrainRegion1>ICX</BrainRegion1>, labelled by injections of biocytin into the <BrainRegion2>central nucleus of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion2> (ICC)
1
In several species, including primates, stimulation studies indicate that the <BrainRegion1>infralimbic cortex</BrainRegion1>, the most caudal part of the <BrainRegion2>ventromedial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion2>, functions as a visceral motor region
0
 To determine the <BrainRegion1>subcortical</BrainRegion1> projections of this region in primates, injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinin, biotinylated dextran amine, or rhodamine-labeled dextran amine were placed in <BrainRegion2>area 25</BrainRegion2> in three monkeys
0
This study examined organization of the projection from the <BrainRegion1>dentate nucleus of the cerebellum</BrainRegion1> to the <BrainRegion2>ventral lateral nucleus (VL) of the thalamus</BrainRegion2> in Macaca mulatta
1
 The distribution of all contralateral terminal fields in the <BrainRegion1>thalamus</BrainRegion1> was charted, and representative individual axons that terminated in the <BrainRegion2>ventral lateral nucleus</BrainRegion2>(VL) were traced in serial sections under the light microscope
0
 The results reveal a complex organization of the input from the <BrainRegion1>ventral dentate</BrainRegion1> to the <BrainRegion2>ventral lateral nucleus</BrainRegion2>(VL) that only partially fits into the traditional concept of somatotopic organization of the nucleus
1
The maturation of the <BrainRegion1>main and accessory olfactory bulb</BrainRegion1> projections to the <BrainRegion2>ventral forebrain</BrainRegion2> of the golden hamster has been traced by using the Fink-Heimer silver technique to stain degenerating axons and terminal arborizations after bulbectomy at different ages between birth and 33 days
1
 Specific anatomical subdivisions of the <BrainRegion1>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion1>(NST) receive taste afferent input and contain interneurons and projection neurons that engage ascending or <BrainRegion2>premotor</BrainRegion2> taste pathways
1
 cholera toxin B(CTb) was injected into the <BrainRegion1>rostral nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion1>(NST) to label, by retrograde transport, the sources of <BrainRegion2>forebrain</BrainRegion2> inputs
0
 Intramedullary cholera toxin B(CTb) labeling after <BrainRegion1>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion1>(NST) injection indicates that the rostral central subdivision also receives projections from the <BrainRegion2>contralateral rostral nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion2>(NST) 
1
 The anterograde tracer experiments indicate that projections from distinct <BrainRegion1>cortical areas</BrainRegion1> terminate primarily in <BrainRegion2>individual longitudinal periaqueductal gray(PAG) columns</BrainRegion2>
1
 A previous study, in the primate, had demonstrated that distinct subgroups of <BrainRegion1>prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion1>(PFC) areas project to specific <BrainRegion2>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion2>(PAG) columns
1
 Anterograde tracing experiments revealed that the projections to different <BrainRegion1>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion1>(PAG) columns arose from specific <BrainRegion2>prefrontal cortical</BrainRegion2>(PFC) areas
1
 As well, consistent with the retrograde data, projections arising from select <BrainRegion1>orbital and agranular insular cortical areas</BrainRegion1> terminated selectively in the <BrainRegion2>vl periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion2>(PAG) 
1
 We show that the nucleus receives inputs from several widely distributed areas in the <BrainRegion1>forebrain</BrainRegion1> and, to a much lesser extent, from the <BrainRegion2>brainstem</BrainRegion2> as well
0
 Overall, the present analysis helps to delineate <BrainRegion1>prosencephalic</BrainRegion1> circuits seemingly critical for the organization of innate fear responses to environmental threats, where the <BrainRegion2>PMd</BrainRegion2> presents a major associative role
0
 Furthermore, by means of massive inputs from the <BrainRegion1>ventral tegmental nucleus</BrainRegion1>, the <BrainRegion2>PMd</BrainRegion2> is in a position to integrate information from a neural system involved in spatial working memory, which may be of particular relevance for an effect of attentional mechanisms on the selection of appropriate escape strategies

 Only <BrainRegion1>area 4</BrainRegion1> projected to the <BrainRegion2>magnocellular red nucleus</BrainRegion2>, and this projection as small
1
The connections between the <BrainRegion1>medial temporal cortical areas</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>CA1 of the hippocampus</BrainRegion2> were examined in the Japanese monkey (Macaca fuscata) by means of retrograde and anterograde tract-tracing methods with wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) and fluorescent dyes (Fast Blue and Diamidino Yellow)
1
 Each of these <BrainRegion1>cortical areas</BrainRegion1> was reciprocally connected with the entire rostrocaudal extent of <BrainRegion2>CA1</BrainRegion2>

0
 The <BrainRegion1>medial temporal cortical areas</BrainRegion1> in direct reciprocal connection with <BrainRegion2>CA1</BrainRegion2> were presumed to be involved in the memory system, especially in the system for declarative memory
1
 The most prominent input to the <BrainRegion1>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion1> (OfB) originated from the <BrainRegion2>diagonal nuclear complex</BrainRegion2>
1
 An exception was the <BrainRegion1>nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract</BrainRegion1>, which was poorly connected with the <BrainRegion2>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion2>(OfB) 
1
 However, there was an <BrainRegion1>accessory amygdala</BrainRegion1>, which could be differentiated from the <BrainRegion2>lateral nuclei</BrainRegion2> by its intense reaction to NADPh-diaphorase
0
 The variability of cell populations and <BrainRegion1>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion1> connections shown here may help to clarify both phylogenetic relationships and the significance of individual basal <BrainRegion2>telencephalic</BrainRegion2> subdivisions

, 2000 [accompanying study]), the <BrainRegion1>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion1>(NRA) and its <BrainRegion2>lumbosacral</BrainRegion2> projections have been identified in the rhesus monkey
0
 The present light and electron microscopical tracing study describes the <BrainRegion1>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion1>(PAG) - <BrainRegion2>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion2>(NRA) pathway in primates
0
 In one of these three monkeys, biotinylated dextran amine and cholera toxin subunit b were injected into the <BrainRegion1>lumbosacral cord</BrainRegion1> to retrogradely identify <BrainRegion2>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion2>(NRA) neurons
0
 The results show that a compact group of neurons in the <BrainRegion1>medial part of the lateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion1>(PAG) at the intercollicular level sends a dense projection to the <BrainRegion2>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion2>(NRA) 
1
 It is concluded that there exists a strong and direct <BrainRegion1>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion1>(PAG) - <BrainRegion2>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion2>(NRA) pathway in the rhesus monkey
0
Auditory information from the <BrainRegion1>posterior thalamus</BrainRegion1> reaches the <BrainRegion2>lateral nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion2> (LA) by way of two pathways: a direct thalamo-amygdala projection and a polysynaptic thalamo-cortico-amygdala projection
1
 Furthermore, the extent and topographical distribution of bifurcating cells that project to both <BrainRegion1>LA</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>auditory association cortex</BrainRegion2>(AAC) are also unknown
0
 There are no apparent differences in the size, shape, or density of terminal specializations in <BrainRegion1>V1</BrainRegion1> or <BrainRegion2>V2</BrainRegion2>, and, consistently with previous double-labeling experiments (Kennedy and Bullier [1985] J Neurosci 5:2815-2830), some axons can branch to both areas
0
The retrospleniocollicular connection is of interest because it constitutes one link between the <BrainRegion1>limbic system</BrainRegion1>, which is considered the anatomical substrate of emotional experience, and the <BrainRegion2>superior colliculus</BrainRegion2> (SC), which mediates approach and avoidance behavior
1
 Terminal fields originating in <BrainRegion1>anterior and posterior regions of the retrosplenial cortex</BrainRegion1> were preferentially distributed in <BrainRegion2>laterodorsal and medioventral collicular regions</BrainRegion2>, respectively, but there were also large, densely innervated regions in which the terminal fields overlapped
1
 [Fluoro-Gold(FG) injections in the <BrainRegion1>superior colliculus</BrainRegion1>(SC) confirmed the retrospleniocollicular topography and demonstrated that this connection originated from layer V pyramidal cells of all <BrainRegion2>retrosplenial areas</BrainRegion2>
1
 The present results demonstrate that the <BrainRegion1>retrosplenial cortex</BrainRegion1> is the origin of a broad and dense network of axonal branches that may modulate <BrainRegion2>superior colliculus</BrainRegion2>(SC) -mediated motor and physiological responses involved in emotional behavior
0
 The results support the subdivision of the <BrainRegion1>orbital and medial prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion1>(PFC) into "medial" and "orbital" networks and suggest that the prefrontostriatal projections reflect the functional organization of the <BrainRegion2>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion2>(PFC) rather than topographic location
0
 In part of a closer investigation of corticohippocampal systems, the authors applied single-axon analysis to the connections from the <BrainRegion1>inferior parietal lobule</BrainRegion1> (IPL) to the <BrainRegion2>presubiculum</BrainRegion2>
1
 For 4 axons, branches were followed to <BrainRegion1>area TF</BrainRegion1> and to the border between the <BrainRegion2>perirhinal and entorhinal cortices</BrainRegion2>, raising the suggestion that these areas, which sometimes are viewed as serial stages, are tightly interconnected

 Comparison of these findings with previous work on other species reveals striking similarities between the <BrainRegion1>pretectorotundal</BrainRegion1> pathway in turtles and birds and in the <BrainRegion2>pretectogeniculate</BrainRegion2> pathway in turtles, birds, and mammals
0
 Corticostriatal projections from focal sites in both <BrainRegion1>somatosensory areas</BrainRegion1> exhibited substantial amounts of divergence within the <BrainRegion2>dorsolateral neostriatum</BrainRegion2>
0
 We found that the proportion of overlapping projections to the <BrainRegion1>neostriatum</BrainRegion1> was moderately correlated with the amount of overlap observed in the <BrainRegion2>thalamus</BrainRegion2>
0
In the present study, anatomical projections from the <BrainRegion1>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion1> (MGB) to <BrainRegion2>primary auditory cortex</BrainRegion2> (AI) were investigated in normal adult cats and in animals that were neonatally deafened with the ototoxic drug amikacin
1
 However, retrograde tracer injections into different regions of <BrainRegion1>auditory cortex</BrainRegion1>(AI) produced a normal pattern of labeling in the <BrainRegion2>ventral division of the medial geniculate body</BrainRegion2> ( medial geniculate body(MGB) v)
1
 In both experimental and control animals, the main mass of labeled <BrainRegion1>thalamic</BrainRegion1> cells was found in the <BrainRegion2>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion2>(MGB) v

 Different isofrequency contours in <BrainRegion1>auditory cortex</BrainRegion1>(AI) receive input from different portions of the <BrainRegion2>medial geniculate body</BrainRegion2>(MGB) v

 The relatively normal thalamocortical projection pattern suggests that, after neonatal <BrainRegion1>cochlear</BrainRegion1> lesions, the major reorganization of cochleotopic maps occurs at <BrainRegion2>subthalamic</BrainRegion2> levels
0
We examined the organization of descending projections from <BrainRegion1>auditory and adjacent cortical areas</BrainRegion1> to the <BrainRegion2>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion2> (IC) in the rat by using the retrograde and anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase
1
The detailed organization of projections from the <BrainRegion1>inferior olive</BrainRegion1> to the <BrainRegion2>cerebellar nuclei</BrainRegion2> of the rat was studied by using anterograde tracing
1
 The interstitial cell groups receive <BrainRegion1>olivary</BrainRegion1> afferents from the <BrainRegion2>intermediate part of the medial accessory olive</BrainRegion2> and from the dorsomedial cell column
0
 A mediolateral topography was noted in the projections from the <BrainRegion1>rostral half of the medial accessory olive</BrainRegion1> to the <BrainRegion2>posterior interposed nucleus</BrainRegion2>
1
 Projections from the <BrainRegion1>dorsomedial group of the principal olive</BrainRegion1> to the <BrainRegion2>dorsolateral hump</BrainRegion2> were found to follow a basically rostrocaudal topography
1
 Its rostromedial parts are directed to the <BrainRegion1>lateral part of the anterior interposed nucleus</BrainRegion1> and its caudolateral part reach the <BrainRegion2>medial anterior interposed nucleus</BrainRegion2>
0
 The objectives of the study were to investigate this backward projection and to compare it with 1) the backward projections that have been described previously in the early sensory areas and 2) the forward projection from <BrainRegion1>area TEO</BrainRegion1> to <BrainRegion2>area TE</BrainRegion2>

 This excitatory input is most likely derived from axons that branch as they pass through the <BrainRegion1>motor thalamus</BrainRegion1> to the <BrainRegion2>lateral habenula</BrainRegion2>
1
 These structures are thought to play differential roles in higher-order discriminative and homeostatic ( <BrainRegion1>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion1>(PBN) ) versus <BrainRegion2>medullary reticular formation</BrainRegion2> ( reflexive function(RF) )
0
 After <BrainRegion1>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion1>(PBN) injections, approximately 18% of the Fos-like immunoreactive (FLI) neurons were double-labeled; after <BrainRegion2>medullary reticular formation</BrainRegion2>(RF) injections the proportion was 9%
0
 On the other hand, regardless of stimulus, twice as many Fos-like immunoreactive(FLI) neurons projected to the <BrainRegion1>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion1>(PBN) as to the <BrainRegion2>medullary reticular formation</BrainRegion2> (RF) 
0
 A plausible hypothesis for reconciling this apparent discrepancy is that many Fos-like immunoreactive(FLI) neurons make local projections in <BrainRegion1>rNST</BrainRegion1>, that in turn give rise to <BrainRegion2>medullary reticular formation</BrainRegion2> (RF) connections
1
 Some afferents showed large, bulb-like enlargements (bulbs) and about 20 of these were found in the <BrainRegion1>anterior and the intermediate octavomotor nucleus</BrainRegion1>, whereas about 40 were found in the <BrainRegion2>posterior octavomotor nucleus</BrainRegion2>
0
 In addition, <BrainRegion1>vestibular primary afferents</BrainRegion1> with bulb-like enlargements(bulbs) in apparent contact with <BrainRegion2>vestibulospinal</BrainRegion2> neurons were transneuronally labeled by biocytin
1
 This anatomical organization suggests that afferents carrying bulb-like enlargements(bulbs) convey dynamic information to <BrainRegion1>vestibulospinal neurons</BrainRegion1>, which, in turn, project to the <BrainRegion2>spinal cord</BrainRegion2> networks

Previous reports using light microscopy have provided anatomical evidence that neurons in the <BrainRegion1>ventrolateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion1> (PAG) innervate the medial pericoerulear dendrites of noradrenergic neurons in the <BrainRegion2>nucleus locus coeruleus</BrainRegion2> (LC)
1
 The present study used anterograde tracing and electron microscopic analysis to provide more definitive evidence that neurons in the <BrainRegion1>ventrolateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion1>(PAG) form synapses with the somata or dendrites of noradrenergic <BrainRegion2>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion2>(LC) neurons
1
 Ultrastructural analysis of anterogradely labeled terminals at the levels of the rostral (n = 233) and caudal (n = 272) subdivisions of the <BrainRegion1>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion1>(LC) indicated that approximately 20% of these form synapses with tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive dendrites; most of these were located in the <BrainRegion2>medial pericoerulear region</BrainRegion2>
0
 These results provide direct evidence for monosynaptic projections from neurons in the <BrainRegion1>ventrolateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion1>(PAG) to the extranuclear dendrites of noradrenergic <BrainRegion2>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion2>(LC) neurons
1
 In contrast, injections centered in the neighboring <BrainRegion1>ventral lateral intraparietal area</BrainRegion1> (LIPv) revealed inputs mainly from <BrainRegion2>extrastriate visual areas</BrainRegion2>, consistent with previous studies

 Both <BrainRegion1>extrabulbar primary</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion2> projections course in diffuse pathways
0
 Extensive overlap was observed between the targets of these <BrainRegion1>extrabulbar primary olfactory</BrainRegion1> fibers and those of the secondary efferent projections of the <BrainRegion2>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion2>, though the latter were more numerous and reached additional targets
0
 Tracer application to the <BrainRegion1>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion1> also revealed a number of bulbopetal neurons in the <BrainRegion2>ipsilateral and contralateral telencephalic areas</BrainRegion2>, as well as crossed interbulbar projections
1
 The presence in a chondrostean of important <BrainRegion1>extrabulbar primary</BrainRegion1> projections and their extensive overlap with <BrainRegion2>secondary olfactory</BrainRegion2> projections suggest that such projections are a derived characteristic of bony fishes
0
The projections from the <BrainRegion1>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion1> to the <BrainRegion2>midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion2> were examined in the rat
1
The projections from the <BrainRegion1>subiculum</BrainRegion1> to the <BrainRegion2>hypothalamus</BrainRegion2> were comprehensively examined in the rat by using the anterograde Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and retrograde cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) methods
1
 The <BrainRegion1>paracentral thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion1> received an input only from the <BrainRegion2>internal lateral parabrachial subnucleus</BrainRegion2>
1
 Finally, the waist area of the <BrainRegion1>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion1> was densely labeled after cholera toxin-beta(CTb) injections in the <BrainRegion2>parvicellular part of the ventral posterior thalamic nucleus</BrainRegion2>
1
 In addition, the developmental changes observed involve both reductions in the total number of <BrainRegion1>thalamic</BrainRegion1> neurons and a differential loss of <BrainRegion2>cortical</BrainRegion2> projections
0
 In series of experiments it was shown that the focus of exciting neurons, forming the descending singular-autonomic discharge is localized in the <BrainRegion1>infragenual area 25</BrainRegion1> of <BrainRegion2>anterior limbic cortex</BrainRegion2>
0
 In another series of microelectrophysiological experiments it was shown downward blocking inhibitory influence of <BrainRegion1>dorsal supragenual area 24 of anterior limbic cortex</BrainRegion1> on activity of vagal viscerosensory neurons of <BrainRegion2>bulbar solitary tract nucleus</BrainRegion2>
0
 Within the <BrainRegion1>A2/C2 region in the nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion1>, 60% of the projecting activated cells were catecholaminergic, as were 59% of such cells in the <BrainRegion2>A1/C1 region of the ventrolateral medulla</BrainRegion2>
0
 This suggests that oxytocin and vasopressin neurons within the <BrainRegion1>supraoptic nucleus</BrainRegion1> are stimulated at parturition via afferent inputs from the <BrainRegion2>brainstem</BrainRegion2>, but the input is not exclusively noradrenergic
1
 Our laboratory has shown that electrical stimulation of the <BrainRegion1>ventrolateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion1> (vl periaqueductal gray(PAG) ) versus the <BrainRegion2>dorsolateral periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion2> (dl periaqueductal gray(PAG) ), in the rabbit, elicits two distinct behavioral/cardiorespiratory response patterns
0
 Separate retrograde tracers were injected into functional subdivisions of the <BrainRegion1>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion1>(PAG) and the <BrainRegion2>amygdaloid central nucleus</BrainRegion2>(ACe) in rabbits
0
 Although double-labeled cells were never observed, afferents to the <BrainRegion1>amygdaloid central nucleus</BrainRegion1>(ACe) were often proximal to <BrainRegion2>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion2>(PAG) afferents

To provide a quantitative comparison of the synaptic organization of "first-order" and "higher-order" <BrainRegion1>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion1>, we followed bias-corrected sampling methods identical to a previous study of the cat <BrainRegion2>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion2> (dLGN; Van Horn et al
0
 However, in comparison to the <BrainRegion1>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion1>(dLGN) , the <BrainRegion2>pulvinar nucleus</BrainRegion2> receives significantly fewer numbers of RL, F1, and F2 contacts and significantly higher numbers of RS contacts
0
 Thus, the RS/RL synapse ratio in the <BrainRegion1>pulvinar nucleus</BrainRegion1> is 24:1, in contrast to the 5:1 RS/RL synapse ratio in the <BrainRegion2>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion2>(dLGN) (Van Horn et al

The function of the corticogeniculate feedback pathway from the <BrainRegion1>striate cortex</BrainRegion1> (V1) to the <BrainRegion2>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion2> (LGN) in primates is not well understood
1
 Pressure injections of biotinylated dextran were made into owl monkey <BrainRegion1>V1</BrainRegion1>, and the resulting labeled axons were reconstructed through serial sections of the <BrainRegion2>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion2>(LGN) 
0
 Unlike corticogeniculate axons seen in the cat, corticogeniculate axons in the owl monkey maintained topographic innervation in the <BrainRegion1>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion1>(LGN) layers that was consistent with receptive field sizes represented in <BrainRegion2>V1</BrainRegion2>

 The distribution of retrogradely labeled neurons showed no clear segregation along the <BrainRegion1>rostrocaudal axis of the claustrum</BrainRegion1>; they were usually located along the entire <BrainRegion2>anteroposterior extent of the claustrum</BrainRegion2>
0
 For all <BrainRegion1>motor cortical areas</BrainRegion1>, there was a general trend of the labeled neurons to occupy the <BrainRegion2>dorsal and intermediate parts of the claustrum</BrainRegion2> along the dorsoventral axis
1
 The same territories were labeled after injection in <BrainRegion1>area 46</BrainRegion1>, but in addition numerous labeled neurons were found in the most <BrainRegion2>ventral part of the claustrum</BrainRegion2>
1
 At higher resolution, however, there was clear evidence that the territories projecting to <BrainRegion1>pre-supplementary motor area</BrainRegion1>(pre-SMA) and <BrainRegion2>SMA-proper</BrainRegion2> formed separate, interdigitating, clusters along the dorsoventral axis
0
 A comparable local segregation was observed for the two subdivisions of <BrainRegion1>area 46</BrainRegion1>, whereas there was more local overlap among the <BrainRegion2>subareas of premotor cortex</BrainRegion2>(PM)

 <BrainRegion1>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion1>(NRA) projections to the <BrainRegion2>lumbosacral cord</BrainRegion2> are species specific and might be involved in mating behavior
1
 In the female cat, this behavior is estrogen dependent, and estrogen induces axonal sprouting in the <BrainRegion1>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion1>(NRA) -<BrainRegion2>lumbosacral</BrainRegion2> pathway
0
 The effect of estrogen was studied on the <BrainRegion1>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion1>(NRA) -l<BrainRegion2>umbosacral</BrainRegion2> projection with the use of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as a tracer in six adult ovariectomized rhesus monkeys with or without estrogen priming (three controls and three treated with 20 microg/day of estradiol benzoate subcutaneously for 14 days)
1
 Light microscopy showed that the density of arborizing labeled <BrainRegion1>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion1>(NRA) axons in the <BrainRegion2>lumbosacral cord</BrainRegion2> was greater in estrogen-treated than in control animals
1
 These findings supported the concept that the <BrainRegion1>nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion1>(NRA) -<BrainRegion2>lumbosacral</BrainRegion2> pathway may be involved in sexual behavior

 The results indicate that the synaptic organization of Gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -positive profiles in the <BrainRegion1>dorsal superficial subdivision of the medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion1>(MGN) nucleus is very similar to that in other <BrainRegion2>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion2>
0
 Especially the dopaminergic cells, located in the <BrainRegion1>pars compacta of substantia nigra</BrainRegion1>(SN) ( <BrainRegion2>substantia nigra</BrainRegion2>(SN) c), are of great neurologic interest, because the functional deficit and depletion of these cells are the correlate of Parkinson's disease
0
 We used a combination of in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on sections of human postmortem <BrainRegion1>mesencephalon</BrainRegion1> to investigate the expression of GABA(A) receptor subunit messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and of the receptor protein in dopaminergic <BrainRegion2>substantia nigra</BrainRegion2>(SN) cells

5) immunolabeling and confocal microscopy on thick sections to examine systematically the terminal arborizations of the various <BrainRegion1>FSC</BrainRegion1> endings and to compare them between two species, the rat and the cat, that have similar-appearing <BrainRegion2>follicle-sinus complexes</BrainRegion2>(FSCs) but different exploratory behaviors, such as existence or absence of whisking
0
 Otherwise, the inner conical body of rat <BrainRegion1>follicle-sinus complexes</BrainRegion1>(FSCs) contains en passant, circumferentially oriented lanceolate endings that are lacking in the cat, whereas the <BrainRegion2>cavernous sinus</BrainRegion2> of the cat has en passant corpuscular endings that are lacking in the rat

 In this study, we made restricted injections of Neurobiotin, which labeled small sectors (300-500 microm) of the <BrainRegion1>cochlear spiral ganglion</BrainRegion1>, to study the projections of <BrainRegion2>auditory nerve</BrainRegion2> fibers representing a narrow band of frequencies
0
 Two injections spaced &amp;gt; or = 2 mm apart in the <BrainRegion1>cochlea</BrainRegion1> resulted in labeled bands of projecting axons in the <BrainRegion2>anteroventral cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion2>(CN) that were 53% broader than would be expected if they were proportional to those in adults, and the two projections were incompletely segregated in the youngest animals studied
1
 Projections to the <BrainRegion1>dorsal division of the cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion1>(CN) were 32% broader in neonates than in adults when normalized, but the <BrainRegion2>dorsal cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion2>(CN) projections were always discrete, even at the earliest ages studied

The organization of backward projections from the <BrainRegion1>anterior part of the inferotemporal cortex</BrainRegion1> (area TE) to the <BrainRegion2>posterior part of the inferotemporal cortex</BrainRegion2> (area TEO) was studied in the macaque monkey by using the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L)

1
 The projection to the <BrainRegion1>caudolateral portion of the ventralis anterior complex</BrainRegion1> (VAC) is located immediately rostral to the area receiving ascending somatosensory afferents and appears to originate, in particular, from the <BrainRegion2>intermediate cerebellar nuclear complex</BrainRegion2>

 In a second group of experiments, newborn ferrets received different combinations of lesions of normal <BrainRegion1>retinal</BrainRegion1> targets and <BrainRegion2>medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion2>(MGN) afferents

 Indeed, the presence of at least some normal <BrainRegion1>retinal</BrainRegion1> targets seems necessary for the formation of <BrainRegion2>retino- medial geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion2>(MGN) connections

 We conclude that the ability of <BrainRegion1>retinal</BrainRegion1> cells to accumulate 3H-GABA does not remain constant during postnatal development; rather each cell population displays a unique maturation sequence that results in a dramatic developmental shift in the number and types of GABA-accumulating cells present in the <BrainRegion2>retina</BrainRegion2>

0
 Since there is an enlarged <BrainRegion1>cortical</BrainRegion1> representation of central vision, the much lower cell densities in "central" parts of <BrainRegion2>area 17</BrainRegion2> than in "peripheral" parts may mean that all parts of the visual field are represented with equal numbers of corticopontine neurons ("linear" representation)
0
 This is not the case, however, since the number of labeled cells per 10 degrees X 10 degrees is considerably higher in the <BrainRegion1>cortex</BrainRegion1> representing the central 10 degrees and medial parts of the lower visual field than in the rest of <BrainRegion2>area 17</BrainRegion2>

0
 The present study demonstrates that calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) , a putative neurotransmitter/neuromodulator, is especially abundant in the <BrainRegion1>rostral cerebral</BrainRegion1> circulation and is derived from the <BrainRegion2>ipsilateral ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve</BrainRegion2>

0
 However, there are a number of significant differences in their distribution; for example, in the reeler mouse, the <BrainRegion1>entorhinal</BrainRegion1> afferents occupy the entire radial extent of the <BrainRegion2>stratum moleculare of the dentate gyrus</BrainRegion2>, whereas in normal mice they are restricted to the outer four-fifths of this layer

0
 Interestingly, this segregation persists into the <BrainRegion1>suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion1>(SCN) , where, as a result, the day-night balance in autonomic function of the organs is affected by specialized <BrainRegion2>pre-sympathetic or pre-parasympathetic suprachiasmatic nucleus</BrainRegion2>(SCN) neurons

 Unlike prior studies, our study focused on the <BrainRegion1>amygdala</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>ventromedial hypothalamus</BrainRegion2>(VMH) , because they are involved in social behaviors and may underlie behavioral differences between the species
0
 Meadow voles had a higher density of cells labeled with the cell proliferation marker 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) in the <BrainRegion1>amygdala</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>DG</BrainRegion2> than did prairie voles
0
 Furthermore, the majority of the 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine(BrdU) -labeled cells in the <BrainRegion1>posterior cortical</BrainRegion1>(pCorA) and <BrainRegion2>pMeA</BrainRegion2> displayed either a neuronal or a glial progenitor phenotype, but no species or treatment differences were found in the percentage of neuronal or glial progenitor cells

Stimulus-evoked metabolic activity in the <BrainRegion1>anterior parietal cortex</BrainRegion1> (<BrainRegion2>areas 3a, 3b, 1, and 2</BrainRegion2>) occurs in the form of column-like patches
0
 If a type of projection connecting <BrainRegion1>areas 3a, 3b, 1, and 2</BrainRegion1> transmits sensory information among these <BrainRegion2>cortical fields</BrainRegion2>, the resultant projection pattern may directly contribute to the definition of somatosensory metabolic "columns
0
" To test this possibility, electrophysiological recordings in <BrainRegion1>areas 3b and 1</BrainRegion1> of Macaca fascicularis monkeys characterized stimuli that elicited the best neuronal response at a specific <BrainRegion2>cortical</BrainRegion2> site
0
 After injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) into physiologically defined loci in <BrainRegion1>area 3b</BrainRegion1>, the patches of transported label within <BrainRegion2>areas 3b and 1</BrainRegion2> were colocalized with evoked metabolic activity
0
 Patches of anterograde label found in <BrainRegion1>area 3b</BrainRegion1> after <BrainRegion2>area 1</BrainRegion2> injections, however, were not coincident with the metabolically activated patches
1
 These findings suggest that excitatory information is transmitted from <BrainRegion1>area 3b</BrainRegion1> to <BrainRegion2>area 1</BrainRegion2> in a way that connects clusters of cells with similar response properties
0
 The patterns of <BrainRegion1>striatal</BrainRegion1> 5'-nucleotidase activity in these animals were compared in serial sections to the patterns of calbindin-D28k immunoreactivity and of 3H-naloxone ligand binding, which respectively mark the known <BrainRegion2>matrix and striosome (patch) compartments of the caudoputamen</BrainRegion2>
0
 Toropetal neurons of the <BrainRegion1>descending octaval nucleus</BrainRegion1>(DO) were within the <BrainRegion2>saccular terminal zone</BrainRegion2>
0
 Of particular note is the <BrainRegion1>medial pretoral nucleus</BrainRegion1>, which received fibers from <BrainRegion2>diencephalic auditory nuclei</BrainRegion2>
1
 The nucleus gave rise to indirect descending pathways to a <BrainRegion1>medial zone of the cerebellar crest</BrainRegion1> where dendrites of crest cells in the <BrainRegion2>secondary octaval</BrainRegion2> population(SO) ramify

 Unlike most vertebrates that have the <BrainRegion1>saccule</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>lagena</BrainRegion2> as two separate pouches ventral to the utricle, the lungfish has a single large ventral pouch that contains a single large pasty otoconial mass
0
 This mass covers two hair cell patches, each like a striola with prominent hair cell ciliary bundles, that are presumed to represent <BrainRegion1>saccular</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>lagenar</BrainRegion2> maculae
0
 The more caudal <BrainRegion1>lagenar</BrainRegion1> striola is a vertically elongated stripe with hair cell orientation vectors facing antiparallel on either side of a midline drawn vertically along the macula, resembling the macula <BrainRegion2>lagena</BrainRegion2> of some bony fishes but not of tetrapods

In rodents, the whisker representation in <BrainRegion1>primary somatosensory (SI) cortex</BrainRegion1> projects to the <BrainRegion2>dorsolateral neostriatum</BrainRegion2>, but the location of these projections has never been characterized with respect to layer IV barrels and their intervening septa
0
 To address this issue, we injected a retrograde tracer into the <BrainRegion1>dorsolateral neostriatum</BrainRegion1> and then reconstructed the location of the labeled corticostriatal neurons with respect to the cytochrome oxidase (CO)-labeled barrels in <BrainRegion2>SI</BrainRegion2>
0
 In the <BrainRegion1>striatum</BrainRegion1>, gradients of neuropil immunostaining define four major territories: The first (T1) includes all but the <BrainRegion2>rostroventral half of the putamen</BrainRegion2> and is characterized by enhanced matriceal parvalbumin(PV) and SMI-32 immunoreactivity (-ir)
0
 The second territory (T2) encompasses most part of the <BrainRegion1>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion1> (Cd) and <BrainRegion2>rostral putamen</BrainRegion2> (PuT), which show enhanced matriceal calbindin-D28K(CB) -ir

 In this study, angiotensin converting enzyme was mapped in the human <BrainRegion1>basal forebrain</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>midbrain</BrainRegion2> by using quantitative in vitro autoradiography employing a derivative of a potent converting enzyme inhibitor, 125I-351A, as radioligand

 prior to pseudorabies virus(PRV) inoculation of the spleen, were located in <BrainRegion1>T(3)-T(12)</BrainRegion1> bilaterally; numerous infected interneurons were also found in the <BrainRegion2>thoracic spinal cord</BrainRegion2> (T(1)-T(13))
0
 These results demonstrate that the sympathetic outflow to the spleen is controlled by a complex multisynaptic pathway that involves several <BrainRegion1>brainstem</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>forebrain nuclei</BrainRegion2>
0
 The output of these nuclei is direct to the <BrainRegion1>central nucleus of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion1>, where binaural inputs synapse with monaural afferents such as those from the <BrainRegion2>cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion2>
0
 Despite the importance of the <BrainRegion1>olivary</BrainRegion1> pathways for binaural information processing, little is known about their synaptic organization in the <BrainRegion2>colliculus</BrainRegion2>
0
 The present study investigates the structure of the projections from the <BrainRegion1>lateral and medial superior olivary nuclei</BrainRegion1> to the <BrainRegion2>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion2> at the electron microscopic level
1
 The results show that the <BrainRegion1>superior olivary complex</BrainRegion1> contributes different patterns of synaptic input to the <BrainRegion2>central nucleus of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion2>
1
 Each projection from the <BrainRegion1>superior olivary complex</BrainRegion1> to the <BrainRegion2>colliculus</BrainRegion2> differs in the number and combinations of endings
1
 Endings from <BrainRegion1>medial superior olive</BrainRegion1> terminate densely in the <BrainRegion2>central nucleus</BrainRegion2>
1
 All endings from the <BrainRegion1>contralateral lateral superior olive</BrainRegion1> terminate much less densely than endings from the <BrainRegion2>medial olive</BrainRegion2>
0
 These data show that the <BrainRegion1>superior olive</BrainRegion1> is a major contributor to the synaptic organization of the <BrainRegion2>central nucleus of the inferior colliculus</BrainRegion2>
1
 The ipsilateral projections of the <BrainRegion1>medial and lateral superior olive</BrainRegion1> may produce higher concentrations of R endings than other inputs to the <BrainRegion2>central nucleus</BrainRegion2>

Intracellular injection of Lucifer Yellow (LY) was used to study the detailed morphology of the normal visually deprived, and light-deprived <BrainRegion1>superior colliculus</BrainRegion1> projecting Type I <BrainRegion2>retinal</BrainRegion2> ganglion cells (RGCs) in hamsters
1
 We conclude that visual or light deprivation has no effect on the morphological development of <BrainRegion1>superior colliculus</BrainRegion1> projecting Type I <BrainRegion2>retinal</BrainRegion2> ganglion cells(RGCs) in hamsters, and the elimination of the transient features on the Type I retinal ganglion cells(RGCs) during development does not depend on visual experience or light stimulation
1
The concept of an early postnatal critical period of development for the <BrainRegion1>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion1> was assessed by determining in adult cats whether previously established properties of <BrainRegion2>geniculate</BrainRegion2> neurons could be altered by varying the cat's visual experience
0
 To explore further the possibility that <BrainRegion1>telencephalic</BrainRegion1> neurons co-containing somatostatin(SS) and neuropeptide Y(NPY) may be evolutionarily conserved among amniotes, we determined the distribution and co-occurrence of somatostatin(SS) and neuropeptide Y(NPY) in <BrainRegion2>forebrain</BrainRegion2> neurons in pigeons

 In contrast, within the <BrainRegion1>basal telencephalon</BrainRegion1> (including the <BrainRegion2>basal ganglia</BrainRegion2> and several other structures) neurons labeled only for neuropeptide Y(NPY) or only somatostatin(SS) were more abundant than those containing both neuropeptides
0
The morphology of single postsynaptic afferent fibers terminating in the <BrainRegion1>feline cuneate nucleus</BrainRegion1> was investigated by using transport of Phasolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin from the <BrainRegion2>cervical spinal cord</BrainRegion2> and intraaxonal injections of horseradish peroxidase into identified postsynaptic fibers in the cuneate fasciculus
0
 Injections of Phaseolus in <BrainRegion1>C5</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>C6</BrainRegion2> of both rhizotomized and non-rhizotomized cats gave similar results and confirmed previous observations with other techniques

Anatomical and physiological studies indicate that the amino acid L-glutamate is the excitatory transmitter in sensory afferent pathways to the <BrainRegion1>amygdala</BrainRegion1> and in intraamygdala circuits involving the <BrainRegion2>lateral and basal nuclei</BrainRegion2>
0
 In contrast, expression of the carboxy terminus segment Deletion I is prominent in the <BrainRegion1>striatum</BrainRegion1> but is not observed in other elements of the <BrainRegion2>basal ganglia</BrainRegion2>
0
NADPH-diaphorase-positive neurons have been demonstrated in the inner nuclear layer and ganglion cell layer of the <BrainRegion1>retina</BrainRegion1> of different mammalian species, but so far no experiments have been conducted to identify whether these cells are amacrine cells and/or <BrainRegion2>retinal</BrainRegion2> ganglion cells
0
 Following unilateral <BrainRegion1>optic nerve</BrainRegion1> section, which leads to the retrograde degeneration of <BrainRegion2>retinal</BrainRegion2> ganglion cells, the numbers of both ND(g) and ND(i) cells did not change significantly for up to 4 months
0
 In addition, when <BrainRegion1>retinal</BrainRegion1> ganglion cells were prelabeled retrogradely (horseradish peroxidase or fluorescent microspheres) and <BrainRegion2>retinas</BrainRegion2> were then stained for NADPH diaphorase, no double-labeled neurons were detected

The motor and sensory connections of the <BrainRegion1>cervical vagus nerve</BrainRegion1> and of its inferior ganglion (nodose ganglion) have been traced in the <BrainRegion2>medulla oblongata</BrainRegion2> of 32 adult cats with the neuroanatomical methods of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) histochemistry and amino acid autoradiography (ARG)
1
 The histochemical and autoradiographic experiments showed that the <BrainRegion1>vagus nerve</BrainRegion1> enters the <BrainRegion2>medulla</BrainRegion2> from its lateral aspect in multiple fascicles and that it contains three major components--axons of preganglionic parasympathetic neurones, axons of skeletal motoneurons, and central processes of the sensory neurons in the nodose ganglion
1
 Afferent fibers in the <BrainRegion1>vagus nerve</BrainRegion1> reached most of the <BrainRegion2>subnuclei of the nTS</BrainRegion2> bilaterally, with the more intense labeling being found on the ipsilateral side

 The <BrainRegion1>mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus</BrainRegion1> is known to be a source of afferents which terminate in layer IV of <BrainRegion2>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion2>

 However, combined retrograde transport and immunohistochemical techniques failed to reveal the presence of cholecystokinin-positive neurons in the <BrainRegion1>mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus</BrainRegion1> that project to <BrainRegion2>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion2>

 This distribution of immunoreactive structures suggests a distinctive role of cholecystokinin in <BrainRegion1>cortical</BrainRegion1> circuitry that is common to every region of <BrainRegion2>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion2>
0
 Most of the labelled somata are situated within three clusters: one below the <BrainRegion1>lateral calyx</BrainRegion1> and two in the <BrainRegion2>anterior-ventral protocerebrum</BrainRegion2>

 Another point is that the numerical density of synapses in the <BrainRegion1>dorsal horn</BrainRegion1> is approximately that of the <BrainRegion2>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion2>

 The content of large dense vesicles and synaptic associations with somata and proximal dendrites suggest that a certain proportion of the tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -containing terminals within the <BrainRegion1>nucleus accumbens</BrainRegion1> are morphologically distinct from catecholaminergic terminals within the <BrainRegion2>dorsal striatum</BrainRegion2>

Saccadic eye movements in the vertical plane are controlled by the <BrainRegion1>rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus</BrainRegion1> (riMLF) and the <BrainRegion2>interstitial nucleus of Cajal</BrainRegion2>

 Injections of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into the area of the <BrainRegion1>caudal central subdivision</BrainRegion1>(CCS) revealed a distinctive subset of retrogradely labeled neurons located in the <BrainRegion2>caudomedial portion of the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus</BrainRegion2>(riMLF) 
1
 Injections of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) that included this <BrainRegion1>caudomedial rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus</BrainRegion1>(riMLF) region anterogradely labeled axons that projected profusely throughout the <BrainRegion2>caudal central subdivision</BrainRegion2>(CCS) 
1
 In summary, these results strongly suggest that the caudomedial part of the cat <BrainRegion1>rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus</BrainRegion1>(riMLF) is a <BrainRegion2>premotor center</BrainRegion2> that monosynaptically controls lid movements in conjunction with vertical saccades

 In older frey, tracers were used to fill retinopetal cells in both the <BrainRegion1>nucleus olfactoretinalis</BrainRegion1> and the <BrainRegion2>diencephalon</BrainRegion2>

 Counts of these cells demonstrated that over one-third of the adult number of retinopetal cells in the <BrainRegion1>nucleus olfactoretinalis</BrainRegion1> are present and have axons in the <BrainRegion2>retina</BrainRegion2> when the fry is 9 days old, and the percentage grows to one-half by the time the fry is 1 month old

 Neurons with crossed descending axons were found in laminae V, VII and VIII, in the medial part of lamina VII including the <BrainRegion1>intermediomedial nucleus of the thoracic levels</BrainRegion1> and close to the <BrainRegion2>central canal</BrainRegion2>
0
 These neurons may function as the long spinal reflex paths for <BrainRegion1>forelimb-hindlimb</BrainRegion1> synergies and the intercalated paths between the supraspinal descending tracts and the <BrainRegion2>spinal motor centers</BrainRegion2>
0
The central axons of Type I spiral ganglion neurons travel in the <BrainRegion1>auditory nerve</BrainRegion1> and terminate in the <BrainRegion2>cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion2>

 The ascending branches of these axons innervate the <BrainRegion1>anteroventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion1> and give rise to large axosomatic endings, called the <BrainRegion2>endbulbs of Held</BrainRegion2>, and smaller boutons

 One site was always in the <BrainRegion1>somatosensory cortex</BrainRegion1>, and the other was in either the <BrainRegion2>visual or the motor cortex</BrainRegion2>

 Although radial fibers emitting collaterals in the lateral segment and in the medial segment of the <BrainRegion1>globus pallidus</BrainRegion1> have been observed, it has not been possible to observe the same radial fiber emitting collaterals in both <BrainRegion2>pallidal segments</BrainRegion2> and the prospects of ever doing so are not good
0
 The radial fibers in the <BrainRegion1>medial segment of the globus pallidus</BrainRegion1> are continuous with the "comb" bundle fibers and appear to be thinner than the radial fibers in the <BrainRegion2>lateral segment of the globus pallidus</BrainRegion2>
0
 It is not proved; nonetheless, the view expressed here is that the radial fibers are thinner in the <BrainRegion1>medial segment of the globus pallidus</BrainRegion1> because they may be the same fibers that gave off collaterals in the <BrainRegion2>lateral segment of the globus pallidus</BrainRegion2>

The density of noradrenergic <BrainRegion1>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion1> projections and beta-adrenergic receptors in the <BrainRegion2>main olfactory bulb</BrainRegion2> of the rat increases with age

 Changes in beta-adrenergic receptor density in response to both early learning and <BrainRegion1>olfactory</BrainRegion1> deprivation may be induced by a transient increase in <BrainRegion2>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion2> norepinephrine
0
 At the same time, the <BrainRegion1>pontine micturition center</BrainRegion1>(PMC) elicits relaxation of the external urethral sphincter (EUS) by excitation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneurons in the <BrainRegion2>sacral dorsal gray commissure</BrainRegion2> (DGC), which, in turn, inhibit external urethral sphincter(EUS) motoneurons
1
 The present study investigated, first, whether there are glycine immunoreactive interneurons in the <BrainRegion1>sacral dorsal gray commissure</BrainRegion1>(DGC) and, second, whether they receive direct <BrainRegion2>pontine micturition center</BrainRegion2>(PMC) afferents
0
 In total 128 labeled <BrainRegion1>pontine micturition center</BrainRegion1>(PMC) terminals were found in the <BrainRegion2>dorsal gray commissure</BrainRegion2>(DGC) , which contained many round vesicles and asymmetric synapses
0
 The results demonstrate that the <BrainRegion1>pontine micturition center</BrainRegion1>(PMC) projects directly to dendrites of interneurons in the <BrainRegion2>sacral dorsal gray commissure</BrainRegion2>(DGC) , which are immunoreactive for both glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA)

 In keeping with the notion that the synaptic component of acetylcholine(ACh) transmission in <BrainRegion1>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion1> is preponderant in layer V, these quantitative data suggest a role for this innervation in the processing of <BrainRegion2>cortical</BrainRegion2> output as well as input
0
 Extrapolation of particular features of this system in terms of total axon length and number of varicosities in whole <BrainRegion1>cortex</BrainRegion1>, length of axons and number of varicosities per cortically projecting neuron, and concentration of acetylcholine(ACh) per axon varicosity, should also help in arriving at a better definition of its roles and functional properties in <BrainRegion2>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion2>

 Here, we define some of the features of the DL corticospinal tract(CST) by tracing corticospinal tract(CST) projections following injections of biotinylated dextran amine into the <BrainRegion1>sensorimotor cortex</BrainRegion1>, assessing the distribution of DL corticospinal tract(CST) axons and terminal arborizations in intact mice and in mice in which the main contingent of corticospinal tract(CST) axons in the <BrainRegion2>dorsal column</BrainRegion2> had been transected
0
 Tracing of DL corticospinal tract(CST) axons in mice with selective lesions of the <BrainRegion1>dorsal column</BrainRegion1> revealed that DL corticospinal tract(CST) axons arborize extensively throughout the <BrainRegion2>dorsal and ventral horns</BrainRegion2> and that the overall territory that the DL corticospinal tract(CST) axons invade is similar to the territory innervated by the corticospinal tract(CST) axons in the main tract

 Several areas of the <BrainRegion1>medullary reticular formation</BrainRegion1> project mainly, and in some cases exclusively, to <BrainRegion2>cervical and thoracic levels</BrainRegion2>

 Our results indicate that <BrainRegion1>spinal</BrainRegion1> projections from <BrainRegion2>bulbar areas of the reticular formation</BrainRegion2> are more complicated than previously supposed
1
 In the <BrainRegion1>olfactory bulbs</BrainRegion1>, both the signal intensity and the number of positive cells were higher with the s GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) probe, whereas sb GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) mRNA-expressing cells were more numerous and intensely stained in the <BrainRegion2>preoptic region</BrainRegion2>

 We tested this prediction by using quantitative techniques to compare the tangential distribution of <BrainRegion1>callosal</BrainRegion1> neurons in the <BrainRegion2>striate cortex</BrainRegion2> of strabismic cats to that in normally reared cats
0
 Animals were rendered strabismic surgically at 8-10 days of age and were allowed to survive a minimum of 18 weeks, at which time multiple intracortical injections of the tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used to reveal the distribution of <BrainRegion1>callosally</BrainRegion1> projecting cells in the <BrainRegion2>contralateral striate cortex</BrainRegion2>
1
 Although our data from strabismic cats do not differ markedly from those reported previously, we find that the distribution of <BrainRegion1>callosal</BrainRegion1> cells in the <BrainRegion2>striate cortex</BrainRegion2> of these cats does not differ significantly from that in our normally reared control cats

 These results do not bear out the prediction that surgically shifting the visual axes leads to stabilization of juvenile <BrainRegion1>callosal</BrainRegion1> axons in anomalous places within the <BrainRegion2>striate cortex</BrainRegion2>

 The <BrainRegion1>commissural</BrainRegion1> projection arising in the <BrainRegion2>ventrolateral vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion2> appeared to be only sparsely developed
1
 The ascending vestibulo-oculomotor projection was found to be organized in an ipsilateral pathway arising in the <BrainRegion1>dorsolateral vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion1> and in a contralateral pathway, arising mainly in the <BrainRegion2>medial vestibular nucleus</BrainRegion2>

 At the light microscopic level, calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) -like immunoreactive ( calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) -I) fibers and substance P(SP) -like immunoreactive ( substance P(SP) -I) fibers were found to pass through the lateral edge of the <BrainRegion1>dorsal horn</BrainRegion1> and then into the <BrainRegion2>dorsal region of the sacral intermediolateral nucleus</BrainRegion2>

 To better understand the role played by SCG10 and stathmin in vivo, we have analyzed the expression and localization of these proteins in both the <BrainRegion1>olfactory</BrainRegion1> epithelium and the <BrainRegion2>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion2> in developing and adult rats, as well as in adult bulbectomized rats
0
 In the <BrainRegion1>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion1> of postnatal and adult rats, a moderate to strong SCG10 immunoreactivity was present in the <BrainRegion2>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion2> layer, whereas no labeling was detected in the glomerular layer

 In this study we assessed synapse density within the <BrainRegion1>hippocampus</BrainRegion1> and the <BrainRegion2>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion2> of Tg2576 mice at 6-18 months of age using stereological methods at both the light and electron microscope levels
0
 Under light microscopy we failed to find overall decreases in the density of synaptophysin-positive boutons in any brain areas selected, but bouton density was significantly decreased within 200 mum of compact beta-amyloid plaques in the outer molecular layer of the <BrainRegion1>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion1> and Layers II and III of the <BrainRegion2>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion2> at 15-18 months of age in Tg 2576 mice
0
 Under electron microscopy, we found overall decreases in synapse density in the outer molecular layer of the <BrainRegion1>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion1> at both 6-9 and 15-18 months of age, and in Layers II and III of the <BrainRegion2>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion2> at 15-18 months of age in Tg 2576 mice

 In the "second" and "third" sensory areas, such as the <BrainRegion1>second somatic sensory</BrainRegion1> and many of the <BrainRegion2>auditory fields</BrainRegion2>, the density of the plexus and its coarseness diminish slightly and the deeper half of layer IV becomes free of terminals

 Where layers V and VI become subdivided in the homotypical <BrainRegion1>cortex</BrainRegion1>, the auditory and adjacent fields were only observed in cases in which the <BrainRegion2>magnocellular nucleus of the medial geniculate body</BrainRegion2> was involved by the injection of isotope

 The boundaries of the <BrainRegion1>cortical</BrainRegion1> projection fields of individual <BrainRegion2>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion2>, as determined autoradiographically, are remarkably sharp and invariably coincide with a sharp architectonic boundary or with a zone of maximal cytoarchitectonic change

 On the other hand, the scatter of fibers from the <BrainRegion1>foveal</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>parafoveal areas</BrainRegion2> progressed gradually through the nerve
0
 However, the <BrainRegion1>temporal central retinal</BrainRegion1> fibers were located in the lateral periphery of the nerve, and they overlapped significantly with fibers from the <BrainRegion2>temporal peripheral retina</BrainRegion2>

 Thus, the present findings based on more precise anatomical techniques indicate that the classical notion of the <BrainRegion1>retinal</BrainRegion1> quadrant topography in the monkey <BrainRegion2>optic nerve</BrainRegion2> probably is suspect

 Mean total cell labeling was less than 400 per <BrainRegion1>spinal segment</BrainRegion1>, suggesting recruitment from a very small fraction of the neurons contained within the <BrainRegion2>spinal cord</BrainRegion2> (calculated at &amp;lt; 0

 We compare the distribution of calcium-binding proteins in the diencephalon of Psammodromus with other vertebrates, with mammals in particular, and suggest that the middle and ventral tiers of the reptilian <BrainRegion1>dorsal thalamus</BrainRegion1> may be comparable to nonspecific or plurimodal <BrainRegion2>posterior/intralaminar thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion2> in mammals, on the basis of the calcium-binding protein expression patterns, as well as the hodological and embryological data in the literature

The efferent connections of different cytoarchitectonic areas of the <BrainRegion1>superior temporal sulcus</BrainRegion1> (STS) in the rhesus monkey with <BrainRegion2>parieto-temporo-occipital cortex</BrainRegion2> were investigated using autoradiographic methods

 There is a correlation between axon number and mitral/tufted cell number during larval development that is consistent with the hypothesis that <BrainRegion1>olfactory</BrainRegion1> axons influence <BrainRegion2>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion2> development

 We have now investigated whether a sciatic nerve crush injury alters the behavioral response in rats to tactile stimuli and whether this is associated with a change in the pattern of c-Fos expression in the <BrainRegion1>dorsal horn</BrainRegion1> and the <BrainRegion2>parabrachial area of the brainstem</BrainRegion2>
0
 C-Fos expression in the <BrainRegion1>dorsal horn</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>parabrachial region</BrainRegion2> was never observed on brushing the skin of the sciatic nerve territory in animals with intact nerves, but was found after sciatic nerve crush with peripheral regeneration
0
 We conclude that after nerve injury, low threshold mechanoreceptor fibers may play a major role in producing pain-related behavior by activating normally nociceptive-specific regions of the central nervous system such as the superficial laminae of the <BrainRegion1>dorsal horn</BrainRegion1> and the <BrainRegion2>parabrachial area</BrainRegion2>

We have examined the circuitry connecting the <BrainRegion1>posterior parietal cortex</BrainRegion1> with the <BrainRegion2>frontal lobe</BrainRegion2> of rhesus monkeys

 HRP-WGA and tritiated amino acids were injected into <BrainRegion1>subdivisions 7m, 7a, 7b, and 7ip of the posterior parietal cortex</BrainRegion1>, and anterograde and retrograde label was recorded within the <BrainRegion2>frontal motor and association cortices</BrainRegion2>

 Our main finding is that each <BrainRegion1>subdivision of parietal cortex</BrainRegion1> is connected with a unique set of <BrainRegion2>frontal areas</BrainRegion2>

 Here we show that relatively mature neurons generated from neurospheres derived from postnatal <BrainRegion1>subependymal zone</BrainRegion1> or <BrainRegion2>cerebellar cortex</BrainRegion2> undergo a phenotypic transformation into astrocytes that coincides with the appearance of a nonfused, hybrid cell type that shares the morphology, antigenicity, and physiology of both neurons and astrocytes

The distribution of terminal projections in the <BrainRegion1>brainstem</BrainRegion1> from lamina I neurons in the <BrainRegion2>spinal dorsal horn</BrainRegion2> was investigated with the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin in the cat and the cynomolgus monkey

 These observations indicate that <BrainRegion1>spinal</BrainRegion1> lamina I neurons project to a variety of <BrainRegion2>brainstem sites</BrainRegion2> involved in autonomic (cardiovascular, respiratory) and homeostatic processing and the control of behavioral state

The genetically determined loss of <BrainRegion1>cerebellar</BrainRegion1> Purkinje cells (PCs) in "Purkinje cell degeneration" (pcd) mutant mice deprives <BrainRegion2>inferior olivary</BrainRegion2> (IO) neurons of their major postsynaptic target

 At the end of various survival periods following unilateral removal of the <BrainRegion1>retina</BrainRegion1>, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was administered to the <BrainRegion2>optic nerve</BrainRegion2> stump by a fiber-filling method
0
 However, approximately 55,000 normal-appearing unmyelinated axons (12% of the unmyelinated fiber population) persisted in the <BrainRegion1>optic nerve</BrainRegion1> at 10 weeks following removal of the <BrainRegion2>retina</BrainRegion2>
0
 It is hypothesized that the potential shown by frog <BrainRegion1>optic</BrainRegion1> axons for long-term survival in the absence of the cell-body expresses a general property of vertebrate (and invertebrate) axons, rather than a special property of the frog <BrainRegion2>optic nerve</BrainRegion2>
0
Short-survival, sequential, and long-survival thymidine radiograms of rat embryos, fetuses and young pups were analyzed in order to delineate the boundaries of the proliferative <BrainRegion1>thalamic</BrainRegion1> neuroepithelium, describe its early transformations, identify its regional divisions, and, finally, attempt to relate its distinct neuroepithelial components to specific <BrainRegion2>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion2> that they supply with neurons
0
 In this introductory paper, some evidence is presented in support of the hypothesis that the identified <BrainRegion1>thalamic sublobules</BrainRegion1> represent putative cell lines committed to produce neurons for specific, early-generated <BrainRegion2>thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion2>
0
 The early derivatives of the <BrainRegion1>intermediate lobule</BrainRegion1> are the <BrainRegion2>sublobules of the ventrolateral and ventrobasal nuclei</BrainRegion2>
0
 The early derivatives of the <BrainRegion1>reticular lobule</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>reticular protuberance are the sublobules of the reticular nuclear complex</BrainRegion2>

 Thus these data indicate a previously unrecognized topographic representation of the vertical dimension of the <BrainRegion1>spiral ganglion</BrainRegion1> across <BrainRegion2>ventral cochlear nuclei</BrainRegion2>(VCN) isofrequency laminae

 In the present study, we investigated the ultrastructure and synaptic targets of <BrainRegion1>hippocampal</BrainRegion1> terminals, as well as their relation to dopamine(DA) terminals within the <BrainRegion2>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion2>(PFC) of adult rats
1
 <BrainRegion1>Hippocampal</BrainRegion1> afferents were labeled either by anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) from the <BrainRegion2>ventral hippocampal formation</BrainRegion2> or by anterograde degeneration following fimbria lesion
0
 <BrainRegion1>Hippocampal</BrainRegion1> terminals in the <BrainRegion2>prefrontal cortex</BrainRegion2>(PFC) , identified by either method, formed primarily asymmetric axospinous synapses, with a small percentage forming asymmetric axodendritic synapses
0
 Thus, the contralateral (to the enucleated eye) <BrainRegion1>colliculi</BrainRegion1> showed a decrease, whereas the <BrainRegion2>ipsilateral colliculi</BrainRegion2> showed an increase in the synapse-to-neuron ratio compared with light-reared, nonenucleated rats
0
 When enucleated rats were reared in the raised in either "light" or "dark"(red light) , there was a decrease in the ratio in both <BrainRegion1>colliculi</BrainRegion1>, although the extent of this decrease was more marked in the contralateral than the <BrainRegion2>ipsilateral colliculi</BrainRegion2>

 By five days of age the caudal region exhibiting a long-lasting degeneration reaction extends from the middle of the <BrainRegion1>olfactory tubercle</BrainRegion1> to the middle of the <BrainRegion2>amygdala</BrainRegion2>

 Examination of thick serial sections and surface preparations with the differential interference contrast microscope (Nomarski optics) allowed direct visualization of individually impregnated <BrainRegion1>spiral ganglion</BrainRegion1> cells, complete with their peripheral processes and endings in the <BrainRegion2>organ of Corti</BrainRegion2>
0
 There are at least two types of <BrainRegion1>spiral ganglion</BrainRegion1> cells in the <BrainRegion2>cochlea</BrainRegion2> of the infant cat and rat
0
 Hence, these ganglion cells establish nearly "point-to-point" connections between the <BrainRegion1>auditory nerve</BrainRegion1> and the <BrainRegion2>organ of Corti</BrainRegion2>
1
 The vagal potential underwent a phase reversal in the middle layers; thus, the current sink site was cytoarchitectonically identified as the <BrainRegion1>most rostral part of the parietal granular cortex</BrainRegion1> or the <BrainRegion2>S1</BrainRegion2>, where no somatosensory input has previously been demonstrated
0
 Double-labeling experiments show that the projections of the subesophageal-calycal tract(SCT) neurons do not overlap with the projections of the <BrainRegion1>olfactory</BrainRegion1> projection neurons and visual projection neurons from the <BrainRegion2>dorsal medulla</BrainRegion2>
0
Neurons in the <BrainRegion1>lateral superior olive</BrainRegion1> are optimally excited by stimulation of the ipsilateral ear, as are those in the <BrainRegion2>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion2> by stimulation of the contralateral ear
0
 Thus, there is a heavy uncrossed projection from the cat <BrainRegion1>lateral superior olive</BrainRegion1> to the <BrainRegion2>inferior colliculus</BrainRegion2> that may be glycinergic and inhibitory

 Positive fibers were also seen in the <BrainRegion1>median eminence</BrainRegion1> and in the <BrainRegion2>neural lobe of the pituitary</BrainRegion2>

The axons of the primary sensory <BrainRegion1>olfactory</BrainRegion1> neurons project from the <BrainRegion2>olfactory neuroepithelium</BrainRegion2> lining the nasal cavity, onto glomeruli covering the surface of the olfactory bulb
0
 The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that phenotypically unique subsets of primary sensory <BrainRegion1>olfactory</BrainRegion1> neurons, scattered throughout the nasal cavity, project to a subset of glomeruli in specific <BrainRegion2>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion2> loci
0
 These data demonstrated that a phenotypically distinct subset of primary sensory olfactory neurons exhibits a topographical projection from the <BrainRegion1>olfactory epithelium</BrainRegion1> to the <BrainRegion2>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion2>, and suggests that these, and other subsets, may form the basis of the mosaic nature of this pathway
1
 Moreover, it appears that the outer nerve fibre layer in the <BrainRegion1>rostral olfactory bulb</BrainRegion1> plays an important instructive role in the guidance and fasciculation of <BrainRegion2>olfactory</BrainRegion2> sensory axons

 In monkeys monocularly treated with tetrodotoxin for 1 day to 2 weeks, both Nuclear respiratory factor 2(NRF-2) alpha expression and c oxidase(CO) activity were reduced in deprived <BrainRegion1>ocular dominance columns of the visual cortex</BrainRegion1> and in deprived layers of the <BrainRegion2>lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion2>

 basic fibroblast growth factor(bFGF) stimulated DNA synthesis by 68% in <BrainRegion1>hippocampus</BrainRegion1>, and by &amp;gt; 250% in <BrainRegion2>pontine subventricular zone</BrainRegion2> (SVZ)
0
 In contrast, incorporation was not altered in <BrainRegion1>basal pons</BrainRegion1> or <BrainRegion2>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion2>, regions in which neurogenesis has already ceased
0
 These results suggest that the specific <BrainRegion1>vibrissal thalamocortical</BrainRegion1> pathway sets up an excitatory synaptic activity in the <BrainRegion2>cortex</BrainRegion2> of the irradiated animal
0
 In contrast to the strong innervation of <BrainRegion1>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>raphe</BrainRegion2> in mammal, the melanin-concentrating hormone(MCH) and hypocretin systems in goldfish barely innervate these aminergic populations related to the regulation of sleep and arousal
0
 melanin-concentrating hormone(MCH) , but not hypocretin, immunoreactive fibers terminate substantially in the sensory layer of the <BrainRegion1>vagal gustatory lobe</BrainRegion1> of goldfish, while both peptidergic systems distribute to the <BrainRegion2>primary visceral sensory areas of the medulla and pons</BrainRegion2>

 In the <BrainRegion1>paraventricular organ</BrainRegion1>(PVO) , Noradrenaline-immunoreactive(NAi) <BrainRegion2>cerebrospinal fluid</BrainRegion2> (CSF)-contacting neurons are located in the same regions where dopamine- and serotonin-containing cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) contacting neurons occur
0
 Interestingly, Noradrenaline-immunoreactive(NAi) fibers form large club endings in some subdivisions of the <BrainRegion1>precerebellar nucleus lateralis valvulae</BrainRegion1>, and parallel fibers in the <BrainRegion2>cerebellar</BrainRegion2> granular layer
0
 Comparison with the distribution of Noradrenaline-immunoreactive(NAi) or dopamine-beta-hydroxylase-immunoreactivity in other species shows that all teleosts studied to date have noradrenergic cells in the <BrainRegion1>locus coeruleus</BrainRegion1> and the <BrainRegion2>caudal rhombencephalon</BrainRegion2>
0
 However, Noradrenaline-immunoreactive(NAi) <BrainRegion1>cerebrospinal fluid</BrainRegion1>(CSF) -contacting <BrainRegion2>paraventricular organ</BrainRegion2>(PVO) cells have been described only in the teleost Gnathonemus petersii and the lizard Gekko gecko (Smeets and Steinbusch: J
0
 It is possible that they might pick up catecholamines as well as serotonin from the <BrainRegion1>cerebrospinal fluid</BrainRegion1>(CSF) , into which monoamines might be released by <BrainRegion2>telencephalic and preoptic subependymal</BrainRegion2> axonal plexuses
0
 Compared with workers, they all have large eyes, relatively larger <BrainRegion1>optic lobes</BrainRegion1>, smaller <BrainRegion2>mushroom bodies</BrainRegion2>, and similarly sized antennal lobes
0
 The input regions of the <BrainRegion1>mushroom bodies</BrainRegion1>, the lip and the collar, generally correlate with the size of the <BrainRegion2>optic and antennal lobe</BrainRegion2>, respectively
0
 For instance, the <BrainRegion1>lateroposterior nucleus</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>pulvinar</BrainRegion2> (LP-PUL) mostly contained thick axons that contributed clusters of large-sized varicosities, each forming multiple asymmetric synapses, usually with vesicle-filled dendrites
0
 Because the <BrainRegion1>caudate nucleus</BrainRegion1> does not project to the <BrainRegion2>thalamus</BrainRegion2>, this labeling had to arise from a neuronal population with branching axons to both structures
0
 Previous findings pointed to three possible sources: <BrainRegion1>brainstem</BrainRegion1> monoaminergic cells, <BrainRegion2>intralaminar thalamic</BrainRegion2> neurons, and corticostriatal cells
0
 Therefore, we concluded that the <BrainRegion1>thalamic</BrainRegion1> anterograde labeling originated from corticostriatal neurons, with axons branching to the <BrainRegion2>thalamus</BrainRegion2>

 A systematic representation of the contralateral body surface was found in <BrainRegion1>lateral parietal cortex</BrainRegion1> adjoining the first somatosensory representation, <BrainRegion2>SmI</BrainRegion2> (Sur et al

 After iontophoretic deposits of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) in the area of the <BrainRegion1>rostral ventral respiratory group</BrainRegion1>(rVRG) , many biotinylated dextran amine(BDA) -labeled terminals in the <BrainRegion2>ventral horn of cervical spinal cord</BrainRegion2> (C4-C5) were immunoreactive for enkephalin and vesicular glutamate transporter-2(VGLUT2)

 Thus, we have studied the membrane availability and intraneuronal distribution of the m2 muscarinic autoreceptor (m2R) in cholinergic neurons of the <BrainRegion1>nucleus basalis magnocellularis</BrainRegion1> (NBM) projecting to the <BrainRegion2>frontal cortex</BrainRegion2> (FC)
0
 The cerebello-pulvinar fibers were found to arise mainly from the <BrainRegion1>parvicellular region of the lateral cerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion1> and to terminate contralaterally in a narrow area at the extreme <BrainRegion2>dorsolateral edge of the pulvinar nucleus</BrainRegion2>(Pul) at the level of the stereotaxic frontal plane A-7
0
 The area of terminal ramification of retino-pulvinar fibers was seen as a thin sheet lying at the extreme <BrainRegion1>lateral edge of the pulvinar nucleus</BrainRegion1>(Pul) through most of the <BrainRegion2>rostrocaudal extent of the pulvinar nucleus</BrainRegion2>(Pul) , bilaterally with contralateral predominance
0
 The <BrainRegion1>cerebellorecipient area in the pulvinar nucleus</BrainRegion1>(Pul) did not seem to overlap with the <BrainRegion2>retinorecipient pulvinar nucleus</BrainRegion2>(Pul) area; the former appeared to be contiguous ventrolaterally to the latter
0
 Collectively, these findings indicate that glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the zebrafish <BrainRegion1>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion1>(OB) and that ionotropic glutamate receptor(iGluR) subtypes function heterogeneously in the <BrainRegion2>bulbar</BrainRegion2> neurons
0
Pyramidal neurons in the mouse <BrainRegion1>SmI cortex</BrainRegion1> were labeled by the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) injected into the <BrainRegion2>ipsilateral MsI cortex</BrainRegion2>
1
 To avoid confusion, terminals in <BrainRegion1>SmI cortex</BrainRegion1> labeled by the anterograde transport of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) injected into <BrainRegion2>MsI</BrainRegion2> were eliminated by lesion-induced degeneration
1
 Although the descending projections were bilateral with an ipsilateral dominance, <BrainRegion1>trigeminal sensory nuclear complex</BrainRegion1>(TSNC) received a more dominant ipsilateral projection than <BrainRegion2>spinal dorsal horn</BrainRegion2>(SpDH) 
0
 The <BrainRegion1>ipsilateral portion of the nucleus nervi oculomotorii</BrainRegion1>, which is located in the <BrainRegion2>rostral ventral tegmentum mesencephali</BrainRegion2>, supplies the musculi recti inferior and medialis and the musculus obliquus inferior without a clear somatotopic representation of the motoneurons
0
 The <BrainRegion1>nucleus nervi trochlearis</BrainRegion1>, which rostrally joins the <BrainRegion2>nucleus nervi oculomotorii</BrainRegion2> with a gap of only about 40 micron between the nuclei, is situated completely contralateral to the musculus obliquus superior supplied by it

Adult rat <BrainRegion1>spinal</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>brainstem</BrainRegion2> motoneurons re-express low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (p75) after their axotomy
0
 Results of these previous studies differed regarding the type of the most effective triggering injury for p75 reexpression, the relative duration of this reexpression and the decrease of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity (-IR) following a permanent axotomy of <BrainRegion1>spinal</BrainRegion1> or <BrainRegion2>brainstem</BrainRegion2> motoneurons
0
 This evidence indicates that <BrainRegion1>spinal</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>brainstem</BrainRegion2> motoneurons respond to a permanent axotomy with a different modulation of p75 and choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) expression

 In colchicine-treated turtles and pigeons, numerous calcitonin-gene-related peptide(CGRP) + perikarya were observed in the <BrainRegion1>auditory relay nucleus</BrainRegion1> of the <BrainRegion2>thalamus</BrainRegion2> (n
0
 Injections of fluorogold into the <BrainRegion1>auditory cortex</BrainRegion1> combined with immunofluorescence labeling for calcitonin-gene-related peptide(CGRP) revealed that calcitonin-gene-related peptide(CGRP) + cells in these areas do, in fact, project to the <BrainRegion2>auditory cortices</BrainRegion2>
1
 These include the possibility that <BrainRegion1>auditory thalamic</BrainRegion1> projections to the <BrainRegion2>telencephalon</BrainRegion2> arose independently in the lines of evolution leading to mammals and sauropsids

 Dual immunostaining for Fluoro-Gold (FG) and ER alpha or Fluoro-Gold(FG) and androgen receptors(AR) showed that over one-third of <BrainRegion1>medial preoptic</BrainRegion1>(MPO) efferents to the <BrainRegion2>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion2>(PAG) contain receptors for either estrogen or androgen
1
 In addition, approximately 50% of <BrainRegion1>periaqueductal gray</BrainRegion1>(PAG) neurons retrogradely labeled from the <BrainRegion2>nucleus paragigantocellularis</BrainRegion2>(nPGi) were immunoreactive for either ER alpha or androgen receptors(AR)

 An analysis of the results demonstrates that the projection to the <BrainRegion1>midline cortex</BrainRegion1> arises in the medial neurons within the <BrainRegion2>caudal two-thirds of the basolateral nucleus</BrainRegion2>
1
 This projection is directed to the <BrainRegion1>anterior cingulate cortex</BrainRegion1>, but not to the <BrainRegion2>posterior cingulate cortex</BrainRegion2>
0
 The <BrainRegion1>primary motor cortex</BrainRegion1> receives a <BrainRegion2>basolateral amygdala</BrainRegion2> projection which originates from neurons in two areas, (1) the medial part of the anterior one-third of the nucleus and (2) the center (in the lateral to medial axis) portion of the posterior two-thirds of the nucleus
1
 These results demonstrate that the <BrainRegion1>basolateral nucleus</BrainRegion1> gives rise to a rather widespread and topographically organized projection to the <BrainRegion2>anterior half of the neocortex</BrainRegion2> of the rat

 Some of the fine fibers in the <BrainRegion1>medial lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion1>(LCN) appeared to be collaterals of thicker fibers that terminated in the <BrainRegion2>lateral lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion2>(LCN)

 The labeling was more sparse than that observed in the <BrainRegion1>medial lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion1>(LCN) after larger <BrainRegion2>dorsal horn</BrainRegion2> injections but displayed the same morphological characteristics

 The Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) observations were corroborated by the presence of many retrogradely labeled lamina I cells at both <BrainRegion1>cervical and lumbar spinal levels</BrainRegion1>, following injections of cholera toxin subunit b or rhodamine-labeled microspheres in the <BrainRegion2>medial lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion2>(LCN) 
0
 These observations indicate that the <BrainRegion1>medial part of the lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion1>(LCN) receives input from lamina I neurons, and probably from lamina III-V neurons as well, at <BrainRegion2>cervical and lumbar spinal levels</BrainRegion2>

 The lamina I input could also be responsible for the general inhibition of lateral <BrainRegion1>lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion1>(LCN) neurons by wide-field noxious stimulation, via activation of GABAergic interneurons in the <BrainRegion2>medial lateral cervical nucleus</BrainRegion2>(LCN)

 In this study, we have analyzed the distribution of <BrainRegion1>spinal cord</BrainRegion1>-projecting <BrainRegion2>paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion2>(PVH) neurons that express vasopressin, an important neuropeptide in autonomic regulation
1
 More than 40% of the <BrainRegion1>spinally</BrainRegion1> projecting neurons in the <BrainRegion2>paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus</BrainRegion2>(PVH) of naive Sprague-Dawley rats were found to express vasopressin mRNA

 The <BrainRegion1>magnocellular subdivisions</BrainRegion1> displayed large numbers of vasopressin mRNA-expressing neurons, but very few of those projected to the <BrainRegion2>spinal cord</BrainRegion2>
1
 The <BrainRegion1>dorsal parvocellular subdivision</BrainRegion1> contained a large number of <BrainRegion2>spinally</BrainRegion2> projecting neurons, but very few of those expressed vasopressin mRNA

Degeneration experiments reveal that the <BrainRegion1>vestibular nerve</BrainRegion1> of the adult opossum distributes to an extensive and diverse area of the <BrainRegion2>brainstem</BrainRegion2> and, as in placental mammals, the traditionally named nuclei do not receive a uniform distribution of primary afferent fibers

1
 In contrast to previous reports in haplorhine primates, which describe the accessory optic system(AOS) as consisting of only the <BrainRegion1>dorsal (DTN) and the lateral (LTN) terminal nuclei</BrainRegion1>, we find that in the gibbon, three cellular groups receive a bilateral projection, predominantly from the <BrainRegion2>contralateral retina</BrainRegion2>

 Specifically, trkB and neurotrophin-3(NT-3) mRNA elevations were restricted to granule cells in the <BrainRegion1>ipsilateral dentate gyrus</BrainRegion1>, whereas bilateral increases in trkC, brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) , and nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA levels occurred in granule cells and <BrainRegion2>hippocampal</BrainRegion2> pyramidal cells

 Projections upon <BrainRegion1>neck premotor</BrainRegion1> neurons arise primarily from neurons in the <BrainRegion2>interstitial region of the vestibular nuclear complex</BrainRegion2>

Olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) axonal extension and targeting occur within the <BrainRegion1>olfactory nerve</BrainRegion1> layer (ONL) of the <BrainRegion2>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion2> (OB)

The distributions of orphanin FQ (OFQ/N; also known as nociceptin) and its cognate receptor, opioid receptor-like receptor-1 (NOP), overlap steroid-responsive regions throughout reproductive circuits of the <BrainRegion1>limbic system</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>hypothalamus</BrainRegion2>
0
 We studied estrogen and progesterone regulation of OFQ/N and NOP mRNA expression in <BrainRegion1>limbic</BrainRegion1>-<BrainRegion2>hypothalamic</BrainRegion2> reproductive circuits
0
 In the <BrainRegion1>caudal part of the posterodorsal medial amygdala</BrainRegion1>, estrogen increased OFQ/N mRNA levels, and progesterone did not alter this increase, whereas, in the <BrainRegion2>medial part of the medial preoptic nucleus</BrainRegion2>, estrogen and progesterone were needed to increase OFQ/N mRNA levels
0
 Steroid regulation of OFQ/N and NOP in the <BrainRegion1>medial preoptic nucleus</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus</BrainRegion2>(VMH) is consistent with emerging data indicating that this opioid system regulates female reproduction

 Moreover, <BrainRegion1>retina</BrainRegion1> input specifies the topography of <BrainRegion2>callosal</BrainRegion2> projections by postnatal day (P)6
1
 After restricted intracortical injections of anterogradely and retrogradely transported tracers we observed that the normal, nonmirror-symmetric <BrainRegion1>callosal</BrainRegion1> map, as well as the anomalous, mirror-symmetric map observed in neonatally enucleated animals, are present by P6-7, just as collateral branches of simple architecture emerge from their parental axons and grow into superficial <BrainRegion2>cortical</BrainRegion2> layers
0
 Our results therefore do not support the idea that <BrainRegion1>retinal</BrainRegion1> input guides <BrainRegion2>callosal</BrainRegion2> map formation by primarily promoting the large-scale elimination of long, nontopographic branches and arbors
0
 Instead, they suggest that <BrainRegion1>retinal</BrainRegion1> input specifies the sites on the parental axons from which interstitial branches will grow to invade middle and upper <BrainRegion2>cortical</BrainRegion2> layers, thereby ensuring that the location of invading interstitial branches is accurately related to the topographical location of the soma that gives rise to the parental axon

 The differential laminar distribution of collateral arbors of single axons along the rostrocaudal axis distinguishes the <BrainRegion1>spinal trigeminal nucleus</BrainRegion1> from the <BrainRegion2>spinal dorsal horn</BrainRegion2> where functional types of mechanoreceptive afferents form continuous or interrupted sagittal columns of terminal arbors that do not shift dorsoventrally within segments

 In normal frontal sections of the <BrainRegion1>medulla oblongata</BrainRegion1>, five columns of fibers surrounded by neuronal cell bodies could be clearly distinguished, but the number is probably fortuitous, for there was no one-on-one relationship with the five <BrainRegion2>trigeminal</BrainRegion2> ganglia

 Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of frog brain, <BrainRegion1>medulla oblongata</BrainRegion1>, and <BrainRegion2>spinal cord</BrainRegion2> extracts revealed that, in all three regions, Urotensin II(UII) -immunoreactive material eluted as a single peak which exhibited the same retention time as synthetic frog Urotensin II(UII)

The projection of the <BrainRegion1>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion1> (EA) to the <BrainRegion2>hippocampus</BrainRegion2> in the cat has been studied by electrophysiological methods
1
 Unit activity elicited by <BrainRegion1>hippocampal</BrainRegion1> stimulation was measured in the <BrainRegion2>entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion2>(EA) 
0
 Assuming that the sites of maximal AEP amplitude correspond to the location of the major synaptic inputs, it can be concluded that the active synaptic inputs arising along a <BrainRegion1>latero-medial axis in the entorhinal cortex</BrainRegion1>(EA) are distributed within the <BrainRegion2>hippocampus</BrainRegion2> according to a septotemporal axis, although with some overlap between the different projections

 Additionally, Eigenmannia has a third class of Purkinje cells, in the <BrainRegion1>eminentia granularis posterior</BrainRegion1>(EGp) and <BrainRegion2>EGm</BrainRegion2>, that never express zebrin II immunoreactivity, indicating that zebrin II expression is not an obligatory feature of Purkinje cell development in all vertebrates

 Interestingly, elevated levels of GIRK2 protein in the Ts65Dn <BrainRegion1>hippocampus</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>frontal cortex</BrainRegion2> correlated with elevated levels of GIRK1 protein
0
 This suggests that heteromeric GIRK1-GIRK2 channels are overexpressed in Ts65Dn <BrainRegion1>hippocampus</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>frontal cortex</BrainRegion2>, which could impair excitatory input and modulate spike frequency and synaptic kinetics in the affected regions
0
 However, in the Ts65Dn mouse a strong immunofluorescent staining of GIRK2 was detected in the lacunosum molecular layer of the <BrainRegion1>CA3 area</BrainRegion1> of the <BrainRegion2>hippocampus</BrainRegion2>

The pattern of projections of peripheral receptors to the <BrainRegion1>neocortex</BrainRegion1> in the <BrainRegion2>second somesthetic receiving area</BrainRegion2> (SII) was mapped in raccoons

 The purpose was to determine if the projection area of peripheral receptors to the forepaw area in the <BrainRegion1>somesthetic receiving area</BrainRegion1>(SII) region is disproportionally enlarged as it is in <BrainRegion2>SI</BrainRegion2>
0
 The forepaw area in <BrainRegion1>somesthetic receiving area</BrainRegion1>(SII) shows an enlargement commensurate with that found in the <BrainRegion2>SI</BrainRegion2>

 The somatotopic organization of mechanoreceptive projections to <BrainRegion1>somesthetic receiving area</BrainRegion1>(SII) is reversed mediolaterally compared to previous descriptions of this arrangement in other mammals: projections form axial structures lie medially and those from apical structures lie laterally along the inferior bank of the <BrainRegion2>suprasylvian sulcus</BrainRegion2> in the raccoon

 These results suggest that the roles of L1 and TAG-1 in the formation of the commissures in the <BrainRegion1>forebrain</BrainRegion1> are different from their roles in the <BrainRegion2>spinal cord</BrainRegion2>

 Anterogradely labeled fibers in the mamillotegmental tract diverged from the principal mamillary tract in an extensive dorsocaudally oriented swath of axons which extended to the <BrainRegion1>dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei</BrainRegion1>, and numerous axons turned sharply ventrally and rostrally to terminate topographically in the <BrainRegion2>dorsomedial nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis and rostromedial pontine nuclei</BrainRegion2>

 We compared the expression patterns of these <BrainRegion1>pallial</BrainRegion1> marker genes with that of the <BrainRegion2>subpallial</BrainRegion2> gene xDistal-less-4 (xDll4)
0
 Our results indicate that the whole <BrainRegion1>pallium</BrainRegion1> of Xenopus expresses the T-box genes XenopusTbr1(xTbr1) and xEomes (in proliferating cells and/or mantle) during embryonic and larval development, and the expression of these genes is topographically complementary to that of xDistal-less-4(xDll4) in the <BrainRegion2>subpallium</BrainRegion2>
0
 On the other hand, during development xEmx1 is expressed in a large part of the <BrainRegion1>pallium</BrainRegion1> (proliferating and postmitotic cells) except for an area adjacent to the <BrainRegion2>pallio-subpallial boundary</BrainRegion2>, where xEmx1 is observed only in some mantle cells
0
 In contrast, the caudal part of the previously termed <BrainRegion1>lateral amygdalar nucleus</BrainRegion1> shows strong xEmx1 expression and may be a <BrainRegion2>lateral pallial</BrainRegion2> derivative
0
 Finally, expression of XenopusTbr1(xTbr1) , xEomes, and xEmx1 is observed in the mitral cell layer of the <BrainRegion1>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion1> from early developmental stages, further supporting that this structure is a <BrainRegion2>pallial</BrainRegion2> derivative

 In the transverse axis, neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive cells seemed to follow a faint suprapyramidal to infrapyramidal gradient, which was due to differential timing of neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive cells destined for the <BrainRegion1>stratum infragranulosum</BrainRegion1> of the suprapyramidal and infrapyramidal blades of the <BrainRegion2>fascia dentata</BrainRegion2>

 Reconstruction of the latter projection has revealed that the fibers are continuous with the <BrainRegion1>olfactory limb of the anterior commissure</BrainRegion1> and the <BrainRegion2>anterior commissure proper</BrainRegion2> suggesting a commissural contralateral projection
0
 Later in development the fiber density in the <BrainRegion1>olfactory limb</BrainRegion1> and the <BrainRegion2>anterior commissure</BrainRegion2> becomes considerably reduced
0
 In contrast, the plexus density in the <BrainRegion1>anterior olfactory nucleus</BrainRegion1> and the granule cell layer of the <BrainRegion2>main and accessory olfactory bulb</BrainRegion2> undergoes only a slight reduction, and the Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive(NPY-ir) cell number remains roughly constant
0
 We found that novel projections from the intact <BrainRegion1>ventral cochlear nucleus</BrainRegion1>(VCN) to <BrainRegion2>ipsilateral medial nucleus of the trapezoid body</BrainRegion2>(MNTB) emerge after lesions performed as late as postnatal day 25
0
 Foliation patterns correlate with the expansion of the <BrainRegion1>cerebellar</BrainRegion1> layers and of total <BrainRegion2>cerebellar area</BrainRegion2>
0
 Furthermore, the temporal-to-septal axis of origin in the <BrainRegion1>septal two-thirds of the subiculum</BrainRegion1> corresponded to a ventrolateral-to-dorsomedial axis of termination in the <BrainRegion2>medial mammillary nucleus</BrainRegion2>
1
 These results suggest that different populations of neurons existing along the longitudinal axis of the <BrainRegion1>subiculum</BrainRegion1> may exert their influences on the execution of different <BrainRegion2>hypothalamic</BrainRegion2> functions

0
 With further development, the <BrainRegion1>retinal basal lamina</BrainRegion1> was not reestablished; newly developing neuroepithelium in the <BrainRegion2>peripheral retina</BrainRegion2>, however, generated an intact basal lamina
0
 The present data demonstrate that the <BrainRegion1>retinal basal lamina</BrainRegion1>, by anchoring the neuroepithelial cells to the pial surface of the <BrainRegion2>retina</BrainRegion2>, has an important function in the development of the normal cytoarchitecture of this structure
0
We have investigated the target dependence of <BrainRegion1>hypoglossal</BrainRegion1> motor neurons in postnatal rats by transecting the <BrainRegion2>hypoglossal nerve</BrainRegion2> and preventing reinnervation of the tongue

 Moreover, many of the dendrites in this <BrainRegion1>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion1>(NTS) region express both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and serotonin (5HT) 2A receptors, and some of these dendrites may arise from the adjacent <BrainRegion2>dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus</BrainRegion2>(DMNV) 
0
The neurogenetic gradients of neurons showing glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) immunoreactivity were determined in the <BrainRegion1>regio superior and in the regio inferior</BrainRegion1> of the mouse <BrainRegion2>hippocampus</BrainRegion2>
0
 Radial gradients of neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive cells are characterized by two main features: 1) with the exception of the <BrainRegion1>stratum lacunosum-moleculare</BrainRegion1> and its interface with the <BrainRegion2>stratum radiatum</BrainRegion2>, glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive neurons of the plexiform strata are generated before those destined for the pyramidal layer; 2) within the pyramidal layer, glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive cells are positioned according to an inside-out sequence
0
 Given the selective laminar disposition of the GABAergic interneurons in the <BrainRegion1>hippocampus</BrainRegion1>, the present authors explored whether or not the diverse types of these interneurons could have specific birth dates and concluded that no relationship exists between birth dates and adult phenotypes of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -immunoreactive cells in the mouse <BrainRegion2>hippocampus proper</BrainRegion2>

We examined in rats the relationship between the ordering of <BrainRegion1>retinal</BrainRegion1> axons in the optic pathway and the formation of a retinotopically organized projection to their primary target, the <BrainRegion2>contralateral superior colliculus</BrainRegion2> (SC)
1
 We have previously found that axons labeled by focal injections of 1,1'-dioctadecyl 3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) made in <BrainRegion1>temporal or nasal retina</BrainRegion1> of perinatal rats commonly mistarget along the medial-lateral and rostral-caudal axes of the <BrainRegion2>superior colliculus</BrainRegion2>(SC) 
0
 In the present study, we made similar 1,1'-dioctadecyl 3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate(DiI) injections, covering less than 2% of the <BrainRegion1>retinal area</BrainRegion1>, in <BrainRegion2>peripheral temporal, nasal, superior, or inferior retina</BrainRegion2>, in rats of two age groups, embryonic day (E) 21 to P (postnatal day) 2 and P11-P17
0
 In <BrainRegion1>retina</BrainRegion1>, labeled axons travel in fascicles directly from the injection site to the <BrainRegion2>optic disc</BrainRegion2>, but neighbor relationships begin to degrade as fascicles split and mix
1
 Retinotopic order is virtually lost in the <BrainRegion1>optic nerve</BrainRegion1>; axons labeled from each injection site disperse throughout its cross-sectional area, but the labeled axons tend to be concentrated toward a specific half of the nerve depending upon their <BrainRegion2>retinal</BrainRegion2> origin
0
 However, the distributions of labeled <BrainRegion1>retinal</BrainRegion1> axons observed in whole mounts of the <BrainRegion2>retina</BrainRegion2> and optic pathway have a degree of disorder similar to those in E21-P2 rats

 The localization of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor subunits to neurons throughout the macaque <BrainRegion1>hypothalamus</BrainRegion1> provides further evidence for the glutamatergic regulation of neuroendocrine, autonomic, and <BrainRegion2>limbic</BrainRegion2> circuits

In neonatal rats the unilateral transection of the <BrainRegion1>cerebellar peduncles</BrainRegion1> causes a fast and complete degeneration of the <BrainRegion2>contralateral inferior olive</BrainRegion2>

 Although its specificity was not totally maintained, the mediolateral distribution of sprouted afferents in the <BrainRegion1>cerebellum</BrainRegion1> matched the caudorostral disposition of parent neurons in the <BrainRegion2>olive</BrainRegion2>, as in the case in normal olivocerebellar projection
0
 Anterograde studies showed that compensatory fibers recrossing the <BrainRegion1>cerebellar</BrainRegion1> midline spread throughout the whole extent of the deprived <BrainRegion2>cortex</BrainRegion2> and terminate solely in the molecular layer as typical climbing fibers

 Corticospinal axons are first present in the <BrainRegion1>contralateral spinal gray of lower cervical cord</BrainRegion1> at day 5 and in the <BrainRegion2>contralateral spinal gray of lower lumbar and sacral cord</BrainRegion2> by day 9

 Therefore, we sought to test the hypothesis that the <BrainRegion1>cardiovascular nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion1>, the site of termination of arterial baroreceptor nerves, projects to <BrainRegion2>pontine</BrainRegion2> preganglionic neurons whose stimulation elicits cerebral vasodilatation
0
 The study establishes the presence of a direct monosynaptic pathway from neurons in the <BrainRegion1>cardiovascular nucleus tractus solitarii</BrainRegion1> to <BrainRegion2>pontine</BrainRegion2> preganglionic parasympathetic neurons that project to the pterygopalatine ganglia, the source of nitroxidergic vasodilatory innervation of cerebral blood vessels

0
 <BrainRegion1>Lateral peristriate</BrainRegion1> differences were less than those of <BrainRegion2>striate cortex</BrainRegion2>, and regions of greater and lesser monocular input could be distinguished
0
 We did not detect differences between the two hemispheres in either anterior or <BrainRegion1>medial peristriate areas</BrainRegion1>, thus indicating either completely binocular input (which seems unlikely given the retinotopic organization of these regions), or a greater dependence than in the <BrainRegion2>lateral peristriate</BrainRegion2> on inputs that were not affected by the visual manipulations

 The same region of the <BrainRegion1>ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion1>(vLGN) was also noted to be reciprocally connected to the <BrainRegion2>contralateral ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion2>(vLGN) 
1
 The deafferented contralateral <BrainRegion1>cortex</BrainRegion1> was defined electrophysiologically, and quantitative estimates of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -immunoreactive fiber density were obtained from the forelimb and hindlimb sectors of <BrainRegion2>area 3b</BrainRegion2> in both hemispheres
0
 In the <BrainRegion1>3b</BrainRegion1> forelimb sector contralateral to the deafferentation, a decrease in density of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive fibers relative to the ipsilateral hemisphere was apparent at 2 weeks and most pronounced at 13 weeks, involving all <BrainRegion2>cortical</BrainRegion2> layers except layer I

 From postmortem studies of eight human <BrainRegion1>cervical spinal cords</BrainRegion1> ranging in age from 11 to 35 weeks postconceptional age, we report that parvalbumin immunoreactivity is similarly plastic in human lower <BrainRegion2>cervical spinal cord</BrainRegion2> development, with many changes occurring prenatally
0
 The proportions of diverging neurons in the afferent projections to <BrainRegion1>areas 17 and 19</BrainRegion1>, and to <BrainRegion2>areas 18 and 19</BrainRegion2> were about 10%

 Diverging neurons were also found in the projections of the <BrainRegion1>intralaminar thalamic nuclei</BrainRegion1> to the <BrainRegion2>visual cortex</BrainRegion2>
1
 However, the immunoreactivities were observed in the accessory optic tract, fasciculus retroflexus, solitary tract, and primary afferent fibers in the superficial layers of the <BrainRegion1>medullary</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>spinal dorsal horns</BrainRegion2>
0
 A prior retrograde tracing study revealed only a minor projection from the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing(HSD2) neurons directly to the <BrainRegion1>central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion1>(CeA) , but these experiments suggested that a more substantial projection may be relayed through the <BrainRegion2>parabrachial nucleus</BrainRegion2>
0
 Small injections of cholera toxin beta subunit (CTb) into the <BrainRegion1>external lateral parabrachial subnucleus</BrainRegion1> (PBel) produced both retrograde cell body labeling in the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing(HSD2) neurons and anterograde axonal labeling in the <BrainRegion2>lateral subdivision of the central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion2>(CeA) 
1
 Complementary cholera toxin beta subunit(CTb) injections, centered in the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing(HSD2) subregion of the <BrainRegion1>nucleus of the solitary tract</BrainRegion1>(NTS) , retrogradely labeled neurons in the <BrainRegion2>medial central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion2>(CeA) 
1
 The 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing(HSD2) neurons may represent one of the functional inputs to the <BrainRegion1>lateral central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion1>(CeA) , and their activity may be modulated by a return projection from the <BrainRegion2>medial central nucleus of the amygdala</BrainRegion2>(CeA)

The laminar origin of <BrainRegion1>cortical</BrainRegion1> projections to the <BrainRegion2>frontal cortex</BrainRegion2> was studied in 17 adult rhesus monkeys with the use of the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)

 Despite the fact that different regions of the <BrainRegion1>central gray</BrainRegion1> were injected in separate animals, the majority of the <BrainRegion2>brainstem areas</BrainRegion2> containing retrogradely filled neurons remained the same
0
 No consistent differences were noted in the location of labeled neurons in either <BrainRegion1>brainstem</BrainRegion1> or <BrainRegion2>spinal</BrainRegion2> sites after dorsal vs
0
 Electron microscopic studies confirmed the presence of mGluR7a in axon terminals in both the <BrainRegion1>striatum</BrainRegion1> and the <BrainRegion2>globus pallidus</BrainRegion2>(GP) and also revealed the presence of mGluR7a at postsynaptic sites in both of these regions

 To determine whether any neurons that express the c-fos protein in response to noxious stimulation project to supraspinal sites, we combined the immunocytochemical localization of c-fos with the localization of a retrogradely transported protein-gold complex that was injected into the <BrainRegion1>thalamic</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>brainstem</BrainRegion2> targets of the major ascending spinal pathways
0
 Using immunocytochemistry, we investigated the distribution of 12 major gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (A) receptor subunits (alpha1-5, beta1-3, gamma1-3, and delta) in the <BrainRegion1>basal ganglia</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>associated limbic brain areas</BrainRegion2> of the rat
0
 In the <BrainRegion1>substantia nigra pars compacta</BrainRegion1> and in the <BrainRegion2>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion2>, numerous presumptive dopaminergic neurons were labeled for subunits alpha3, gamma3, and/or delta
0
 This highly heterogeneous distribution of individual gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (A) receptor subunits suggests the existence of differently assembled, and presumably also functionally different, gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (A) receptors within individual nuclei of the <BrainRegion1>basal ganglia</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>associated limbic brain areas</BrainRegion2>
0
 The motor nucleus also receives an extensive bilateral input from the <BrainRegion1>pontine</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>medullary reticular formation</BrainRegion2>
0
 Smaller, <BrainRegion1>lateral reticular formation</BrainRegion1> neurons were concentrated rostrally and ipsilaterally in the <BrainRegion2>nucleus pontis lateralis</BrainRegion2>

 The findings suggest that the <BrainRegion1>caudal medial cerebellar nucleus</BrainRegion1>(MCN) in the rat, like the primate <BrainRegion2>fastigial nucleus</BrainRegion2>, is involved in the control of eye movement
0
The present study was conducted to examine the plasticity of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-immunoreactive terminals in the rat <BrainRegion1>phrenic nucleus</BrainRegion1> following an ipsilateral C2 <BrainRegion2>spinal cord</BrainRegion2> hemisection and 30-day survival period

 In an attempt to study the morphology and distribution of Vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) + cells in the <BrainRegion1>retina</BrainRegion1> of the rhesus monkey in more detail, we subjected Vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) + cells observed in cryostat sections or wholemounts rhesus monkey <BrainRegion2>retinae</BrainRegion2> to a quantitative analysis
0
 In terms of their type, laminar location, number, and targets, the synapses that formed the <BrainRegion1>V2</BrainRegion1> projection to <BrainRegion2>V3 A</BrainRegion2> are typical of a major, excitatory, feedforward projection of macaque visual cortex
1
The efferent projection from the <BrainRegion1>rostral cortices of the temporal lobe</BrainRegion1> to the <BrainRegion2>magnocellular division of the medial dorsal nucleus</BrainRegion2> (MDmc) was studied in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta)
1
 They make up the largest part of the temporal tip and separate the <BrainRegion1>pyriform cortex</BrainRegion1> from the architecturally more progressive isocortical divisions of the pole found laterally at the rostral ends of the <BrainRegion2>superior and inferior temporal gyri</BrainRegion2>
0
 Intracortical injections restricted to <BrainRegion1>lateral polar isocortex</BrainRegion1> did not result in either anterograde or retrograde transport of label to <BrainRegion2>magnocellular division of the medial dorsal nucleus</BrainRegion2>(MDmc) 
0
 In normal rats the crossed parabigeminotectal projection is restricted to the superficial layers in <BrainRegion1>anterior and medial areas of colliculus</BrainRegion1>, regions innervated also by the lower temporal portion of the <BrainRegion2>ipsilateral retina</BrainRegion2>
1
 In unilaterally enucleated animals the crossed parabigeminotectal projection to the "denervated" <BrainRegion1>colliculus</BrainRegion1> is expanded, as is the <BrainRegion2>retinal</BrainRegion2> projection from the ipsilateral eye
1
 In addition, there is a crossed <BrainRegion1>parabigeminal</BrainRegion1> projection to the "denervated" <BrainRegion2>dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus</BrainRegion2> in these rats
1
 The existence of an expanded parabigeminotectal projection in bilaterally enucleated rats shows that a sustained ipsilateral retinotectal projection is not necessary for the establishment of a crossed parabigeminotectal projection, but points to the possibility that <BrainRegion1>ipsilateral retinal</BrainRegion1> input may constrain the <BrainRegion2>parabigeminal</BrainRegion2> projection to terminate within certain boundaries
0
 These findings suggest that cholinergic inputs to the <BrainRegion1>ventral tegmental area(VTA) mediate complex</BrainRegion1> synaptic actions, with a major portion of this effect likely to involve an excitatory influence on dopamine(DA) <BrainRegion2>mesoaccumbens</BrainRegion2> neurons
0
 As such, the results suggest that natural and drug rewards operating through cholinergic afferents to the <BrainRegion1>ventral tegmental area</BrainRegion1>(VTA) have a direct synaptic link to the <BrainRegion2>mesoaccumbens</BrainRegion2> dopamine(DA) neurons that modulate approach behaviors

 Second, the inner small-celled region is a group of small cells located between the external <BrainRegion1>medullary</BrainRegion1> lamina (ventrally) and the medial margin of the ventral regions of the main body of the <BrainRegion2>reticular nucleus</BrainRegion2>: the inner small-celled region is clearly differentiated in cats only
0
 We suggest that the inner small-celled region may constitute a previously undescribed dorsal extension of the <BrainRegion1>zona incerta</BrainRegion1>, rather than a subdivision of the <BrainRegion2>reticular nucleus</BrainRegion2>

 The main projections from the <BrainRegion1>caudal Nucleus retroambiguus</BrainRegion1>(NRA) involved motoneurons in the <BrainRegion2>thoracic and upper-lumbar cord</BrainRegion2> that supply abdominal wall and cremaster muscles
1
 <BrainRegion1>Nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) -spinal</BrainRegion1> projections, especially those involving the <BrainRegion2>upper lumbar cord</BrainRegion2>, were sexually dimorphic, being more extensive in males than in females
1
 This study determined which elements in <BrainRegion1>caudal medial accessory subdivision of the inferior olive</BrainRegion1>(cMAO) serve as the postsynaptic targets of the gracile projection and whether these elements also receive input from the <BrainRegion2>lumbosacral spinal cord</BrainRegion2>
0
 This termination pattern contrasts markedly with that of other somatosensory inputs to the <BrainRegion1>inferior olive</BrainRegion1> and may account for the greater heterogeneity in responses to somatosensory stimuli displayed by neurons in <BrainRegion2>caudal medial accessory subdivision of the inferior olive</BrainRegion2>(cMAO) 
0
 The most likely source of these inhibitory synapses is the <BrainRegion1>parasolitary nucleus</BrainRegion1>, a structure that has been shown by others to receive input from the <BrainRegion2>cerebellum</BrainRegion2>
1
 Axons that form the adult uncrossed retinofugal projection arise from the temporal crescent of the <BrainRegion1>retina</BrainRegion1> and reach the <BrainRegion2>optic chiasm</BrainRegion2> on postnatal day 7
0
 The abrupt divergence of the uncrossed fibres occurs at a border between two glial cell types: the interfascicular glia that characterise the main part of the <BrainRegion1>optic nerve</BrainRegion1> and the radial glia of the <BrainRegion2>juxtachiasmatic</BrainRegion2> part of the nerve

In order to investigate the expression of cell adhesion molecules in synapses, we have studied the localization of the neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM in the <BrainRegion1>cerebellum</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>hippocampus</BrainRegion2> of adult mice by immunocytological and immunochemical methods
0
 N-CAM 180 does not appear to be differentially expressed in synapses of a particular morphological type, but is detectable in all types of synapses in the <BrainRegion1>cerebellum</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>hippocampus</BrainRegion2>, except for mossy fiber synapses and synapses between basket and Purkinje cells, which are generally N-CAM 180-negative

 In addition, the level of calretinin immunostaining ipsilaterally within neurons in the <BrainRegion1>LSO</BrainRegion1> was significantly less in <BrainRegion2>cochlear</BrainRegion2> ablated than control animals
0
 Thus, <BrainRegion1>cochlear</BrainRegion1>-driven activity appears to affect calcium binding protein levels in both neuropil and neurons within the <BrainRegion2>superior olivary complex</BrainRegion2>

 Injections of the lectin tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) were placed into several levels of the <BrainRegion1>lateral nucleus</BrainRegion1> and the distribution of fibers in the <BrainRegion2>basal (basolateral) nucleus</BrainRegion2> was evaluated
0
 In general, the heaviest labeling of the <BrainRegion1>basal nucleus</BrainRegion1> was observed after injections at <BrainRegion2>midrostrocaudal levels of the lateral nucleus</BrainRegion2>, especially when the injection was located ventrally
1
 Injections placed caudally in the <BrainRegion1>lateral nucleus</BrainRegion1> resulted in light to medium levels of labeled fibers in the <BrainRegion2>basal nucleus</BrainRegion2>; the terminal field in these cases did not extend as far rostrally as after the rostral and midlevel injections

0
 Some of these cells--particularly those in the <BrainRegion1>spinal cord</BrainRegion1> and <BrainRegion2>olfactory bulb</BrainRegion2>--are found in central nervous system regions that receive local RA signals early in development, and retain a significant amount of functional or structural plasticity in the adult

Dopamine (DA) influences a number of cognitive and motor functions that are mediated by the primate <BrainRegion1>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion1>, and the DA membrane transporter (DAT) is known to be a critical regulator of DA neurotransmission in <BrainRegion2>subcortical</BrainRegion2> structures in rodents
0
 To gain insight into the possible functional role of <BrainRegion1>cortical</BrainRegion1> DAT, we compared the regional, laminar, and ultrastructural distribution of DAT immunoreactivity to that of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in DA synthesis, in the <BrainRegion2>cerebral cortex</BrainRegion2> of macaque monkeys
0
, <BrainRegion1>posterior parietal cortex</BrainRegion1>, <BrainRegion2>dentate gyrus</BrainRegion2>) not previously thought to receive a substantial DA input
0
 For example, in contrast to TH, DAT immunoreactivity in the <BrainRegion1>cortex</BrainRegion1> was localized predominantly to small-diameter profiles, whereas, in the <BrainRegion2>dorsolateral caudate nucleus</BrainRegion2>, DAT and TH immunoreactivities were present in both large-diameter and small-diameter profiles, which may represent varicose and intervaricose axon segments, respectively
0
 In particular, these observations reveal an anatomical substrate for a direct and potent influence of DA over neuronal activity in <BrainRegion1>posterior parietal cortex</BrainRegion1> and in certain regions of the <BrainRegion2>temporal lobe</BrainRegion2>
0
 Moreover, this distribution of DAT suggests that <BrainRegion1>cortical</BrainRegion1> DA fibers may permit greater neurotransmitter diffusion than <BrainRegion2>subcortical</BrainRegion2> DA axons
