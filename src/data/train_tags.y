 thinner in the medial segment of the globus pallidus because they may be the same fibers that gave off collaterals in the lateral segment of the globus pallidus
The density of noradrenergic locus coeruleus projections and beta-adrenergic receptors in the main olfactory bulb of the rat increases with age
 Changes in beta-adrenergic receptor density in response to both early learning and olfactory deprivation may be induced by a transient increase in olfactory bulb norepinephrine
 At the same time, the pontine micturition center(PMC) elicits relaxation of the external urethral sphincter (EUS) by excitation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneurons in the sacral dorsal gray commissure (DGC), which, in turn, inhibit external urethral sphincter(EUS) motoneurons
 The present study investigated, first, whether there are glycine immunoreactive interneurons in the sacral dorsal gray commissure(DGC) and, second, whether they receive direct pontine micturition center(PMC) afferents
 In total 128 labeled pontine micturition center(PMC) terminals were found in the dorsal gray commissure(DGC) , which contained many round vesicles and asymmetric synapses
 The results demonstrate that the pontine micturition center(PMC) projects directly to dendrites of interneurons in the sacral dorsal gray commissure(DGC) , which are immunoreactive for both glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) 
 In keeping with the notion that the synaptic component of acetylcholine(ACh) transmission in cerebral cortex is preponderant in layer V, these quantitative data suggest a role for this innervation in the processing of cortical output as well as input
 Extrapolation of particular features of this system in terms of total axon length and number of varicosities in whole cortex, length of axons and number of varicosities per cortically projecting neuron, and concentration of acetylcholine(ACh) per axon varicosity, should also help in arriving at a better definition of its roles and functional properties in cerebral cortex
 Here, we define some of the features of the DL corticospinal tract(CST) by tracing corticospinal tract(CST) projections following injections of biotinylated dextran amine into the sensorimotor cortex, assessing the distribution of DL corticospinal tract(CST) axons and terminal arborizations in intact mice and in mice in which the main contingent of corticospinal tract(CST) axons in the dorsal column had been transected
 Tracing of DL corticospinal tract(CST) axons in mice with selective lesions of the dorsal column revealed that DL corticospinal tract(CST) axons arborize extensively throughout the dorsal and ventral horns and that the overall territory that the DL corticospinal tract(CST) axons invade is similar to the territory innervated by the corticospinal tract(CST) axons in the main tract
 In nasal retina, the ganglion cells had degenerated because they were axotomized by the optic chiasm section
 Immunoreactivity was also seen in the cells of layers 2, 3A, 4B, 5, and 6 of area 17 and layers 3 and 5 of area 18
 Subsequently, they lose their tangential orientation, enabling them to make contact with the axons of the olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) that innervate the whole olfactory bulb(OB) 
 From here, cells extend around the caudal part of the ventromedial and dorsomedial nuclei and the base of the diencephalon
 A corresponding dorsoventral asymmetry in myeloarchitecture supports the idea that V3 is an area that is restricted to dorsal extrastriate cortex and lacks a complete representation of the visual field
Transneuronal tracing techniques were used to identify the putative spinal and brainstem neurons involved in continence and voiding in the female rat
 After both bladder base and bladder body injections, the majority of pseudorabies virus-labelled cells were found in the lateral gray and medial cord of L6-S1
 A number of those found in the intermediolateral cell column resembled the parasympathetic preganglionic neurons; the remaining neurons in the lateral and medial gray were presumed to be interneurons
 Several areas of the medullary reticular formation project mainly, and in some cases exclusively, to cervical and thoracic levels
 Our results indicate that spinal projections from bulbar areas of the reticular formation are more complicated than previously supposed
 In the olfactory bulbs, both the signal intensity and the number of positive cells were higher with the s GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) probe, whereas sb GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) mRNA-expressing cells were more numerous and intensely stained in the preoptic region
 Additionally, the parabrachial region(PBR) may mediate more subtle changes in thalamic activity as attentional levels fluctuate during the waking state
 In the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus(dLGN) and pulvinar nucleus, we quantitatively analyzed the distribution of muscarinic type 2(M2) receptors using electron microscopy
 We tested this prediction by using quantitative techniques to compare the tangential distribution of callosal neurons in the striate cortex of strabismic cats to that in normally reared cats
 Animals were rendered strabismic surgically at 8-10 days of age and were allowed to survive a minimum of 18 weeks, at which time multiple intracortical injections of the tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used to reveal the distribution of callosally projecting cells in the contralateral striate cortex
 Although our data from strabismic cats do not differ markedly from those reported previously, we find that the distribution of callosal cells in the striate cortex of these cats does not differ significantly from that in our normally reared control cats
 These results do not bear out the prediction that surgically shifting the visual axes leads to stabilization of juvenile callosal axons in anomalous places within the striate cortex
 The retinal pigment epithelium(RPE) develops from the outer layer of the optic cup which by E45 consists of a multistratified epithelium
 From the density of radiolabelled cells, and data on the overall density of retinal pigment epithelium(RPE) cells in the juvenile retina, we determined the labelling index
 retinal pigment epithelium(RPE) cell genesis begins near the fovea, and proceeds towards the periphery
 Cell division largely ceases in both foveal and perifoveal regions by E56, at which time labelled cells first begin to appear peripheral to the equator
 A prolonged postnatal period of low density retinal pigment epithelium(RPE) cell genesis persists in both central and peripheral retina
 Comparison of the pattern of expansion of the area containing radiolabelled cells in the retinal pigment epithelium(RPE) and neuroretina demonstrates a remarkable spatial and temporal correspondence
 The posterior thalamic(Po) and parafascicular(Pf) were then dissected free and processed for electron microscopy by using standard methods
 A survey of the general ultrastructure of posterior thalamic(Po) and parafascicular(Pf) revealed many RS profiles (small with round vesicles) making asymmetric synapses around single, small (distal; 0
 There were no profiles making synapses on other vesicle-filled profiles seen, reflecting the scarcity of interneurons in the posterior thalamic(Po) and parafascicular(Pf) of rats
2 microm in diameter; n = 238), contained round vesicles, and made asymmetric synapses with proximal ( approximately 75%) and, to a lesser extent, distal ( approximately 25%) dendrites; they formed part of the RS population of the posterior thalamic(Po) and parafascicular(Pf) 
 Somatosensory maps derived from multiunit microelectrode recordings revealed a complete somatosensory representation of the contralateral body surface within a large region of midrostral cortex (primary somatosensory cortex, or S1)
 A second representation, the second somatosensory area (or S2), was found adjacent and caudolateral to S1 as a mirror image reversed along the representation of the glabrous snout
 A reversal of somatotopic order and an enlargement of receptive fields marked the transition from S1 to S2
 In the ventral telencephalon, radial glia, striatal, and migratory GABAergic neurons expressed CXCR4
 Tangentially migrating CXCR4-expressing neurons populated the marginal zone and started to invade the lateral intermediate zone at embryonic day (E)14
 During invasion of the cortical plate the orientation of CXCR4-immunoreactive neurons changed gradually from tangential (E17/E18) to radial (postnatal day [P] 0), which was paralleled by downregulation of SDF-1alpha in the intermediate/subventricular zone
 In summary, SDF-1alpha is expressed along cortical but not subcortical migration routes of GABAergic neurons
 Fibers fasciculate into bundles as they arise in the retina and reach the chiasma by NF Stage 32
 Because the retina grows in rings at its margins, ganglion cell axons differentiate at the periphery and join the nearest fiber bundles (fascicles) to reach the optical disc
 Wedges of ganglion cells send their axons into a common fascicle which retains its integrity as it leaves the retina at the optic disc
 About 75 immunoreactive perikarya are grouped into clusters in the optic lobe and in the median and dorsal protocerebrum

 The expression and localization of Vesicle associated membrane protein(VAMP) isoforms in the salamander retina, a major model system for studies of retinal circuitry, was examined by using immunocytochemical and immunoblotting methods
The early postnatal development of cholecystokinin-immunoreactive (CCK-ir) neurons was analyzed in visual areas 17 and 18 of cats aged from postnatal day 0 to adulthood
 The first population consists of five cell types which appear perinatally in areas 17 and 18
 The second population consists of two cell types which appear around the end of the second and during the third postnatal week in areas 17 and 18
 Labeled PVCN cells, consisting of multipolar, octopus, and small spindle-shaped cells, were located in spatially restricted laminae stretching the entire rostrocaudal length of the nucleus, while labeled AVCN cells consisting of multipolar, globular, small spindle-shaped and small spherical cells were broadly distributed over the posterior half of the nucleus
 Injections placed in the posterior half of the AVCN resulted in only very few labeled cells in the DCN
 Cones containing both S and L/M opsin (S+L/M) appear around the fovea shortly after L/M opsin is expressed, are found in more peripheral retina at older ages, and decrease in number after birth
 In this study, we examine the organization of the forebrain afferents to the parabrachial nucleus(PB) 
 In general, forebrain areas tend to innervate the same parabrachial nucleus(PB) subnuclei from which they receive their input
 Our results show that the forebrain afferents of the parabrachial nucleus(PB) are topographically organized
 Early T-cell infiltration and microglial activation in periventricular and superficial white matter structures adjacent to meninges suggested initial recruitment of effector T cells via the cerebrospinal fluid and choroid plexus
Previous observations indicate that the basal forebrain receives dopaminergic input from the ventral midbrain
 At the ultrastructural level, about 40% of the selected Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) -labeled presynaptic terminals in the ventral pallidum and substantia innominata were found to establish synaptic specializations with ChAT-containing profiles, most of which on the cell body and proximal dendritic shafts
 Corresponding to the differences in the peripheral olfactory apparatus, the central olfactory projections were also asymmetric
 The nucleus intercalatusspinalis and the dorsal commissural nucleus (between T13 and L2), both of which contain preganglionic neurons, are densely innervated
 The results suggest that the paraventriculo-spinal pathway is particularly related to specific groups of sympathetic and parasympathetic preganglionic neurons, and to the marginal zone, whick is involved in the relay of ascending nociceptive information through the spinothalamic tract
 In mouse and rat spinal cord, [(125)I]-deltorphin-labeled delta opioid receptors(DOR) binding sites were detected throughout the gray matter
The morphology and distribution of dopaminergic interplexiform cells in adult rat and monkey retinas were analyzed to determine any correlation with the function of dopamine in the outer retinal layers
 Their density was higher in the superior retina than in the inferior retina of the rat and was especially high in the superior temporal quadrant
 At embryonic day 12 (E12) in mice, the expression of Islet1(Isl1) marks distinctively the ventral portion of the nascent cochlear epithelium encompassing the primordial organ of Corti
In order to identify cytochemical traits relevant to understanding excitatory neurotransmission in brainstem auditory nuclei, we have analyzed in the dorsal cochlear nucleus the synaptic distribution of aspartate aminotransferase, glutamate, and vesicular zinc, three molecules probably involved in different steps of excitatory glutamatergic signaling
 Neuropeptide Y ( Neuropeptide Y(NPY) ) at 10-1,000 nM caused a concentration-dependent, long-lasting reduction of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in the hippocampal subfield CA1 and the area dentata, and an even stronger reduction of population spikes
 There is a dense innervation of CA1 by Neuropeptide Y(NPY) -immunoreactive axons and terminals, particularly in the stratum moleculare
 Male rats were injected with True Blue into the dorsal vagal complex and with FluoroGold into the intermediolateral column of the lower thoracic spinal cord
 Expression of c-Fos was prominent in several of the subnuclei of the paraventricular nucleus and in the adjacent perifornical nucleus
 Neurones projecting to the spinal cord were prominent in the dorsal, lateral, and ventral portion of the medial parvicellular subnuclei of the PVN
 Hardly any PVN neurones projecting to the dorsal vagal complex were concomitantly Fos-positive
 A considerably larger (&amp;gt;10%) proportion of perifornical neurones projecting to the nucleus of the solitary tract were c-Fos-immunopositive
 dopamine beta-hydroxylase(DBH) staining was confined to sparse networks of weakly fluorescent fibers with the highest numbers in the internal plexiform layer of the accessory olfactory bulb(AOB) and fewer fibers in the external plexiform, rostral, and granular layers of the main olfactory bulb(MOB) 
 The subnuclei of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius(nTS) receiving baroreceptor and chemoreceptor afferents--dorsolateral and dorsal (dl and d) subnuclei of nucleus of the tractus solitarius(nTS) --showed scattered substance P immunoreactive nerve terminals
 An important result of these experiments was the observation that regions of the medulla adjacent to the nucleus of the tractus solitarius(nTS) , i
Cells in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body were intracellularly labeled in brainstem tissue slices of two bat and two rodent species
 The main cell type found in this nucleus, the principal cell, is an important link in the relay of ascending projections from the contralateral cochlear nucleus to the lateral superior olive, completing an essential pathway for sound localization
 Although the dendrites of most labeled cells were confined to the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, some principal cells had dendrites that spread outside the nucleus to one of several adjacent periolivary cell groups
 The periaqueductal gray(PAG) does not project directly to the motoneurons innervating the muscles involved in mating, but is thought to make use of the nucleus retroambiguus (NRA) as relay
 The nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) is located ventrolaterally in the most caudal medulla, and projects directly to iliopsoas and cutaneus trunci motoneuronal cell groups
 These results correspond with the hypothesis that in hamster the periaqueductal gray(PAG) - nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) -motoneuronal projection not only involves motoneurons of iliopsoas and cutaneus trunci but also of lateral longissimus(LL) and quadratus lumborum(QL) 
 galanin-immunoreactive(GAL-IR) fibers were present in neurohypophyseal digitations of both the anterior and intermediate lobes with highest density in the region of the proximal pars distalis, where growth hormone and gonadotropic cells are located
 On the ipsilateral side, these cells were located in the caudal portion of the ophthalmic-maxillary region and, less often, in the mandibular division
 On the contralateral side, most labelled ganglion cells were visible in the anteromedial part of the ophthalmic-maxillary region but a few could also be seen in the mandibular division
) were made in different folia of the paramedian lobule of cats, and the sites of occurrence of labeled cells in the inferior olive were precisely determined
 The phenomenon that following microinjections of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) in superficial parts of the folia labeled cells occur within parts only of the regions of the olive which contain labeled cells following large horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -injections in the paramedian lobule is discussed
 Mormyrid fish showed the strongest immunoreactivity in the knollenorgan electroreceptor pathway; in the nucleus of the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) and the big cells of the nucleus exterolateralis pars anterior
 In the electromotor system, two nuclei in the corollary discharge pathway showed labeling: in the paratrigeminal command-associated nucleus and the juxtalobar nucleus
 The electromotor system showed labeling in the lateral relay nucleus and less strongly in the medullary relay nucleus, but none in the pacemaker
A discrete preganglionic cell column (column of Terni, CT) in the caudal thoracolumbar (segments 21-23) spinal cord is first discernible in a avian embryos on day 8 when it contains approximately 9,300 visceral motoneurons
 Daily injections of nerve growth factor (NGF) (1-20 micrograms) on the chorioallantoic membrane from day 3 to day 9 produced a dose-dependent increase in both the volume of the caudal thoracolumbar sympathetic ganglia and the number of motoneurons in the corresponding CT on day 10
 Nerve growth factor decreased the number of pyknotic (dying) neurons in both the thoracolumbar sympathetic ganglia and the corresponding CT on days 8 and 10
 The increased number of neurons in both the thoracolumbar sympathetic ganglia and the corresponding CT following chronic administration of nerve growth factor(NGF) is the result of decreased cell death
 Daily injections of nerve growth factor(NGF) (10-20 micrograms) from day 10 until day 14 increased the volume of (and the number of neurons in) the caudal thoracic sympathetic ganglia on day 15 but no effect on the number of motoneurons in the corresponding CT
 In the toadfish utricle, glutamatergic hair cells are present throughout the macula
 The first pathway arises from neurons which send axons to the contralateral medial longitudinal fasciculus (cMLF neurons); cMLF neurons show excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) after stimulation of the ipsilateral pontine gigantocellular tegmental field (PFTG)
 No cMLF neurons with axon collaterals in the BFTG are present in the data of this study
 About half of iBRF neurons have bifurcated axon collaterals with both anterior and posterior projections, and in these neurons antidromic spike potentials are elicited by stimulation of the ipsilateral PFTG
 connexin family of proteins(Cx) 26 is also expressed in the CNS, primarily in the leptomeningeal linings, but is also reported in astrocytes and in neurons of developing brain and spinal cord
 The trunk of the ALLN divides into dorsal and ventral roots as it enters the medulla
 A portion of the ascending fibers continue more rostrally and terminate in the ipsilateral eminentia granularis and bilaterally in the cerebellar corpus
 The ventral part of the peptide-positive area overlaps with the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra in which the TH-positive dendrites extend
 Adult neurogenesis was also detected in the optic lobes but not in the antennal lobes
 The first somatostatin immunoreactive somata in the lizard forebrain appeared on E36, and they were located in non cortical areas
 Then, on E39 and later, somatostatin immunoreactive neurons were seen in the lizard cortex in a rostral-to-caudal spatial gradient, which parallels that of the normal histogenesis of the lizard cerebral cortex
 On E39, labelled somata were seen in the medial and dorsal cortex inner plexiform layers; immunoreactive puncta and dendritic processes were detectable in the inner plexiform layer of the medial cortex
 On P28, groups of labelled neurons appeared in the cell layer of dorsal and lateral cortices, reaching the adult-mature pattern of somatostatin immunoreactivity in the lizard cerebral cortex, i
 Immunoreactive somata and processes occupied all the cortical areas, but they were especially abundant in the dorsomedial cortex
 The most conspicuous finding regarding the location of slowly adapting lung stretch(SAR) terminals is that they are concentrated within specific subnuclear groups of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (nTS) and are distributed widely in the rostrocaudal plane of the medulla oblongata
The nucleus of the pontobulbar body (PBu) in the North American opossum is located, for the most part, adjacent to the motor root of the trigeminal nerve
 Although there is some topography to such projections, it is not sharply defined and many regions of the pontobulbar body(PBu) contain labelled neurons after injections of horseradish peroxidase into widely separate areas of the cerebellar cortex
 Because of its embryogenesis and position, the pontobulbar body(PBu) is often considered part of the dorsolateral basilar pons
 Donor hypothalami were obtained from normal Long-Evans fetuses and transplanted to the lateral, third, or fourth ventricle of Brattleboro rats
 Although suprachiasmatic nucleus(SCh) were identified in grafts recovered from each intraventricular transplantation site, an appreciable input to the host brain could be identified only when the fetal tissue was grafted to the third ventricle
An atlas of transverse sections of the globus pallidus and striatum was established in macaque with reference to ventricular coordinates
 Both a personal case studied with autoradiography and data from literature were used to analyze the distribution of cortical axons into the striatum
 Each pallidal dendritic disc is able to receive axons from a wide region of the striatum
 Substance P-positive cells and processes were found in the optic tectum and in the visual Wulst
 The area containing medial terminal nucleus(MTN) terminal fibers and the area occupied by nucleus of the optic tract(NOT) -IO neurons has been found to match
 Intracerebroventricular infusions of nerve growth factor(NGF) into the third ventricle adjacent to the preoptic area resulted in a 58% increase in relative cellular levels of trkA mRNA in the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca(DBB) 
 These data provide evidence that both p75 nerve growth factor(NGF) R and trkA are expressed by nerve growth factor(NGF) -responsive neurons in the medial septum(MS) and diagonal band of Broca(DBB) 
 The focal regions of activity occurred in pairs involving both medial and lateral representations in the bulb, perhaps reflecting the paired medial and lateral projections of olfactory sensory neurons expressing specific types of odorant feature receptor proteins
Serial section electron microscopy has been used to examine a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labelled group Ia afferent collateral from its entry point in the grey matter to its termination in Clarke's column of the cat spinal cord
 The results suggest that the dorsal and ventral respiratory groups form an extensively interconnected neuronal system receiving convergent inputs from the same brainstem nuclear groups, consistent with the hypothesis that the dorsal and ventral groups are primarily sites for integration of sensory and premotor respiratory drive inputs
Understanding the interaction of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum requires knowledge of the highly complex spatial characteristics of cerebro-cerebellar signal transfer
 This non-overlapping distribution is consistent with a compartmentalized organization of the cerebro-pontine projection and may be the basis of the fractured type of maps found in the cerebellar granular layer
 This matches the diameter of dendritic trees of layer 5 projection neurons, indicating that non-overlapping populations of neocortical projection neurons possess non-overlapping patches of pontine terminals
 Because the calbindin-rich and -poor regions of P(3) corresponded to differential patterns of cortical connectivity, the results suggest that calbindin(CB) may further delineate functional subdivisions in the pulvinar
 Caudally, the nucleus consists of a small number of loosely aggregated neurons lying lateral to the ventral periaqueductal gray matter at a rostrocaudal level corresponding to the rostral one-fifth of the somatic cell columns of the oculomotor nucleus
 Rostrally, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal(INC) increases in size and reaches its maximum development in its rostral half, where it lies ventrolateral to the nucleus of Darkschewitsch (ND)
 Injections of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) into lesions at cervical, thoracic, or lumbar levels of the spinal cord resulted in retrograde labelling of neurons of all sizes and shapes throughout the entire length of the interstitial nucleus of Cajal(INC) 
 However, the greatest number of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -labelled cells in interstitial nucleus of Cajal(INC) were observed subsequent to injections of the enzyme into cervical levels of the cord
 Following injections of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) into the inferior olive only small to medium-sized neurons were labelled in the nucleus, the majority of which are located in rostral levels of the interstitial nucleus of Cajal(INC) 
 The sizes of the projections from these two nuclei to the inferior olive appeared to be much larger than that from the interstitial nucleus of Cajal(INC) 
 Smaller numbers of neurons were also observed in the rostral parvocellular red nucleus (RN) and mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF)
 The tectal gray has predominantly ascending projections to the diencephalon
 The tectal gray also projects topographically to layers 4 and 8-13 of the optic tectum
 In the 2-deoxyglucose(2-DG) experiments, bats presented with second harmonic frequency modulated(FM) stimuli alone showed uptake of label in specific regions of the central nucleus and dorsal cortex of the inferior colliculus, and the nucleus of the brachium
 We combined immunoperoxidase labeling of the anterograde tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHAL) with immunogold-silver labeling of tyrosine hydroxylase to determine whether this enzymatic marker for catecholamines was present in efferents from the area postrema or their targets in the rat nucleus tractus solitarii(NTS) 
 At survival periods of 10-12 days after Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHAL) injections into the area postrema, light microscopy revealed numerous varicose processes containing peroxidase reaction product for Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHAL) in the dorsomedial, medial, and commissural nucleus tractus solitarii(NTS) 
 We conclude that a few catecholamine, but mainly noncatecholamine efferents from the area postrema provide a monosynaptic, and most likely inhibitory input to target neurons both with and without tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the dorsomedial and commissural nucleus tractus solitarii(NTS) 
 Synapses between the efferent terminals from the area postrema and tyrosine hydroxylase labeled and unlabeled dendrites as well as unlabeled axons in these specific subnuclei of the nucleus tractus solitarii(NTS) suggest multiple sites for modulation of gastric and cardiovascular reflexes in response to circulating peptides
 Confocal three-dimensional reconstructions revealed clusters of postsynaptic density(PSD) s along proximal dendrites of transfected pyramidal neurons in area CA3, but not in CA1
 Examination of Golgi-impregnated specimens demonstrates that the Ju has precise boundaries primarily determined by a conical condensation of fibers of the stria terminalis (StT) around the nucleus
 Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) injections into layers IV, V, and VI reveal widespread efferent projections to all of the more superficially located layers of the medial entorhinal area(MEA) in addition to projections to the lateral EA
 Taken together, the findings of the present experiments suggest that (1) all layers of the medial entorhinal area(MEA) have longitudinal projections directed primarily toward the ventral (or temporal) part of this cortex, (2) the projections of layers II and III are relatively restricted compared of the deeper layers
Cells of the corpus striatum arise from the lateral ganglionic eminence of the telencephalic neuroepithelium
 Two principal conclusions are drawn: Progenitors at the different rostrocaudal levels are heterogeneous with regard to the pattern of cellular proliferation, and ganglionic progenitors are in advance of the cerebral cortical progenitors based on the relative size of the secondary proliferative population and the magnitude of cytokinetic parameters
To follow on a recent quantitative study of the developing cholinergic (ACh) innervation in rat neocortex, axon varicosities identified by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry with a highly sensitive antibody against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) were examined in the primary somatosensory area (Par1) of rats at postnatal ages (days) P8, P16, and P32
In the present study some afferent, commissural, and efferent connections of the vestibular nuclear complex in the turtle Pseudemys scripta elegans were demonstrated with the HRP tracing technique
 Distinct commissural projections appeared to arise in the dorsolateral, ventromedial, and descending vestibular nuclei
 The commissural projection arising in the ventrolateral vestibular nucleus appeared to be only sparsely developed
 The ascending vestibulo-oculomotor projection was found to be organized in an ipsilateral pathway arising in the dorsolateral vestibular nucleus and in a contralateral pathway, arising mainly in the medial vestibular nucleus
 Finally, several neurons in the lumbar enlargement were labeled retrogradely with FluoroRuby after injections into the nucleus raphe obscurus(nRO) and the immediately adjacent reticular formation
 At the light microscopic level, calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) -like immunoreactive ( calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) -I) fibers and substance P(SP) -like immunoreactive ( substance P(SP) -I) fibers were found to pass through the lateral edge of the dorsal horn and then into the dorsal region of the sacral intermediolateral nucleus
 In addition, substance P(SP) -I fibers also extend from the dorsolateral funiculus into the entire sacral intermediolateral region
 For example, LAR mRNA is highly expressed by both proliferating and postmitotic cells in the cerebral cortex at embryonic day 17 and in all layers of the cortex at postnatal day 4
 To better understand the role played by SCG10 and stathmin in vivo, we have analyzed the expression and localization of these proteins in both the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb in developing and adult rats, as well as in adult bulbectomized rats
 In the olfactory bulb of postnatal and adult rats, a moderate to strong SCG10 immunoreactivity was present in the olfactory nerve layer, whereas no labeling was detected in the glomerular layer
 In this study we assessed synapse density within the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex of Tg2576 mice at 6-18 months of age using stereological methods at both the light and electron microscope levels
 Under light microscopy we failed to find overall decreases in the density of synaptophysin-positive boutons in any brain areas selected, but bouton density was significantly decreased within 200 mum of compact beta-amyloid plaques in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and Layers II and III of the entorhinal cortex at 15-18 months of age in Tg 2576 mice
 Under electron microscopy, we found overall decreases in synapse density in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus at both 6-9 and 15-18 months of age, and in Layers II and III of the entorhinal cortex at 15-18 months of age in Tg 2576 mice
 These results provide the first quantitative morphological evidence at the ultrastructure level of a spatial relationship between beta-amyloid plaques and synapse loss within the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex of Tg2576 mice

A cytoarchitectonic parcellation has been made of the cortex of the insula and of the adjoining parts of the temporal and parietal lobes in rhesus and squirrel monkeys
 In the "second" and "third" sensory areas, such as the second somatic sensory and many of the auditory fields, the density of the plexus and its coarseness diminish slightly and the deeper half of layer IV becomes free of terminals
,in areas 3b and AI) there is labeling of the superficial half of layer VI
 Where layers V and VI become subdivided in the homotypical cortex, the auditory and adjacent fields were only observed in cases in which the magnocellular nucleus of the medial geniculate body was involved by the injection of isotope
 The boundaries of the cortical projection fields of individual thalamic nuclei, as determined autoradiographically, are remarkably sharp and invariably coincide with a sharp architectonic boundary or with a zone of maximal cytoarchitectonic change
 As early as stage 33, nitrergic cells were observed in the caudal rhombencephalon within the developing inferior reticular nucleus
Tectal tissue was dissected from fetal rats and transplanted adjacent to the superior colliculus of newborn rats
 The projection from host cortex (particularly from visual cortical areas) was the densest and most consistent projection
The frontal lobe connections of different architectonic areas of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) in the rhesus monkey were investigated with the aid of both anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques
 The mid-portion of polymodal cortex projects to, and receives fibers from, rostral subdivisions of lateral prefrontal cortex, viz
 On the other hand, the scatter of fibers from the foveal and parafoveal areas progressed gradually through the nerve
 However, the temporal central retinal fibers were located in the lateral periphery of the nerve, and they overlapped significantly with fibers from the temporal peripheral retina
 Thus, the present findings based on more precise anatomical techniques indicate that the classical notion of the retinal quadrant topography in the monkey optic nerve probably is suspect
 Mean total cell labeling was less than 400 per spinal segment, suggesting recruitment from a very small fraction of the neurons contained within the spinal cord (calculated at &amp;lt; 0
The mitral cell of the olfactory bulb is the primary relay neuron that transmits information from the olfactory receptors to the rest of the brain
 In vitro olfactory bulb neurons and their dendrites from embryonic day (E) 18 olfactory bulbs responded to t-ACPD and quisqualate, selective and nonselective metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists, and to several ionotropic glutamate agonists with increases in intracellular Ca2+ as studied with fura-2 digital imaging
 The pretectum displays the most intense expression of parvalbumin within the diencephalon
 We compare the distribution of calcium-binding proteins in the diencephalon of Psammodromus with other vertebrates, with mammals in particular, and suggest that the middle and ventral tiers of the reptilian dorsal thalamus may be comparable to nonspecific or plurimodal posterior/intralaminar thalamic nuclei in mammals, on the basis of the calcium-binding protein expression patterns, as well as the hodological and embryological data in the literature
The efferent connections of different cytoarchitectonic areas of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) in the rhesus monkey with parieto-temporo-occipital cortex were investigated using autoradiographic methods

 Faint projections were demonstrated to the nucleus of the posterior commissure and the nucleus of Darkschewitsch
 Unlike the sensorimotor apparatus controlling limb and body movements, the brainstem regions controlling the head and neck received prominent cortical projections
 There is a correlation between axon number and mitral/tufted cell number during larval development that is consistent with the hypothesis that olfactory axons influence olfactory bulb development
 We have now investigated whether a sciatic nerve crush injury alters the behavioral response in rats to tactile stimuli and whether this is associated with a change in the pattern of c-Fos expression in the dorsal horn and the parabrachial area of the brainstem
 C-Fos expression in the dorsal horn and parabrachial region was never observed on brushing the skin of the sciatic nerve territory in animals with intact nerves, but was found after sciatic nerve crush with peripheral regeneration
 We conclude that after nerve injury, low threshold mechanoreceptor fibers may play a major role in producing pain-related behavior by activating normally nociceptive-specific regions of the central nervous system such as the superficial laminae of the dorsal horn and the parabrachial area
We have examined the circuitry connecting the posterior parietal cortex with the frontal lobe of rhesus monkeys
 HRP-WGA and tritiated amino acids were injected into subdivisions 7m, 7a, 7b, and 7ip of the posterior parietal cortex, and anterograde and retrograde label was recorded within the frontal motor and association cortices
 Our main finding is that each subdivision of parietal cortex is connected with a unique set of frontal areas
 Here we show that relatively mature neurons generated from neurospheres derived from postnatal subependymal zone or cerebellar cortex undergo a phenotypic transformation into astrocytes that coincides with the appearance of a nonfused, hybrid cell type that shares the morphology, antigenicity, and physiology of both neurons and astrocytes
The distribution of terminal projections in the brainstem from lamina I neurons in the spinal dorsal horn was investigated with the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin in the cat and the cynomolgus monkey
 These observations indicate that spinal lamina I neurons project to a variety of brainstem sites involved in autonomic (cardiovascular, respiratory) and homeostatic processing and the control of behavioral state
The genetically determined loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) in "Purkinje cell degeneration" (pcd) mutant mice deprives inferior olivary (IO) neurons of their major postsynaptic target
 The medial accessory olive (MAO) appeared less affected than the principal (PO) and the dorsal accessory olive (DAO)
 Motoneurons innervating the palatoglossus are located in the nucleus ambiguus and, possibly, in dorsolateral hypoglossal nucleus regions
 At the end of various survival periods following unilateral removal of the retina, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was administered to the optic nerve stump by a fiber-filling method
 However, approximately 55,000 normal-appearing unmyelinated axons (12% of the unmyelinated fiber population) persisted in the optic nerve at 10 weeks following removal of the retina
 It is hypothesized that the potential shown by frog optic axons for long-term survival in the absence of the cell-body expresses a general property of vertebrate (and invertebrate) axons, rather than a special property of the frog optic nerve
Short-survival, sequential, and long-survival thymidine radiograms of rat embryos, fetuses and young pups were analyzed in order to delineate the boundaries of the proliferative thalamic neuroepithelium, describe its early transformations, identify its regional divisions, and, finally, attempt to relate its distinct neuroepithelial components to specific thalamic nuclei that they supply with neurons
 In this introductory paper, some evidence is presented in support of the hypothesis that the identified thalamic sublobules represent putative cell lines committed to produce neurons for specific, early-generated thalamic nuclei
 The early derivatives of the intermediate lobule are the sublobules of the ventrolateral and ventrobasal nuclei
 The early derivatives of the reticular lobule and reticular protuberance are the sublobules of the reticular nuclear complex
 Thus these data indicate a previously unrecognized topographic representation of the vertical dimension of the spiral ganglion across ventral cochlear nuclei(VCN) isofrequency laminae
 In the present study, we investigated the ultrastructure and synaptic targets of hippocampal terminals, as well as their relation to dopamine(DA) terminals within the prefrontal cortex(PFC) of adult rats
 Hippocampal afferents were labeled either by anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) from the ventral hippocampal formation or by anterograde degeneration following fimbria lesion
 Hippocampal terminals in the prefrontal cortex(PFC) , identified by either method, formed primarily asymmetric axospinous synapses, with a small percentage forming asymmetric axodendritic synapses
 Thus, the contralateral (to the enucleated eye) colliculi showed a decrease, whereas the ipsilateral colliculi showed an increase in the synapse-to-neuron ratio compared with light-reared, nonenucleated rats
 When enucleated rats were reared in the raised in either "light" or "dark"(red light) , there was a decrease in the ratio in both colliculi, although the extent of this decrease was more marked in the contralateral than the ipsilateral colliculi
 By five days of age the caudal region exhibiting a long-lasting degeneration reaction extends from the middle of the olfactory tubercle to the middle of the amygdala
 Examination of thick serial sections and surface preparations with the differential interference contrast microscope (Nomarski optics) allowed direct visualization of individually impregnated spiral ganglion cells, complete with their peripheral processes and endings in the organ of Corti
 There are at least two types of spiral ganglion cells in the cochlea of the infant cat and rat
 Hence, these ganglion cells establish nearly "point-to-point" connections between the auditory nerve and the organ of Corti
 The vagal potential underwent a phase reversal in the middle layers; thus, the current sink site was cytoarchitectonically identified as the most rostral part of the parietal granular cortex or the S1, where no somatosensory input has previously been demonstrated
 Double-labeling experiments show that the projections of the subesophageal-calycal tract(SCT) neurons do not overlap with the projections of the olfactory projection neurons and visual projection neurons from the dorsal medulla
Neurons in the lateral superior olive are optimally excited by stimulation of the ipsilateral ear, as are those in the inferior colliculus by stimulation of the contralateral ear
 Thus, there is a heavy uncrossed projection from the cat lateral superior olive to the inferior colliculus that may be glycinergic and inhibitory
 Positive fibers were also seen in the median eminence and in the neural lobe of the pituitary
The axons of the primary sensory olfactory neurons project from the olfactory neuroepithelium lining the nasal cavity, onto glomeruli covering the surface of the olfactory bulb
 The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that phenotypically unique subsets of primary sensory olfactory neurons, scattered throughout the nasal cavity, project to a subset of glomeruli in specific olfactory bulb loci
 These data demonstrated that a phenotypically distinct subset of primary sensory olfactory neurons exhibits a topographical projection from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb, and suggests that these, and other subsets, may form the basis of the mosaic nature of this pathway
 Moreover, it appears that the outer nerve fibre layer in the rostral olfactory bulb plays an important instructive role in the guidance and fasciculation of olfactory sensory axons
 In monkeys monocularly treated with tetrodotoxin for 1 day to 2 weeks, both Nuclear respiratory factor 2(NRF-2) alpha expression and c oxidase(CO) activity were reduced in deprived ocular dominance columns of the visual cortex and in deprived layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus
 basic fibroblast growth factor(bFGF) stimulated DNA synthesis by 68% in hippocampus, and by &amp;gt; 250% in pontine subventricular zone (SVZ)
 In contrast, incorporation was not altered in basal pons or cerebral cortex, regions in which neurogenesis has already ceased
 These results suggest that the specific vibrissal thalamocortical pathway sets up an excitatory synaptic activity in the cortex of the irradiated animal
 In contrast to the strong innervation of locus coeruleus and raphe in mammal, the melanin-concentrating hormone(MCH) and hypocretin systems in goldfish barely innervate these aminergic populations related to the regulation of sleep and arousal
 melanin-concentrating hormone(MCH) , but not hypocretin, immunoreactive fibers terminate substantially in the sensory layer of the vagal gustatory lobe of goldfish, while both peptidergic systems distribute to the primary visceral sensory areas of the medulla and pons
 In the paraventricular organ(PVO) , Noradrenaline-immunoreactive(NAi) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting neurons are located in the same regions where dopamine- and serotonin-containing cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) contacting neurons occur
 Interestingly, Noradrenaline-immunoreactive(NAi) fibers form large club endings in some subdivisions of the precerebellar nucleus lateralis valvulae, and parallel fibers in the cerebellar granular layer
 Comparison with the distribution of Noradrenaline-immunoreactive(NAi) or dopamine-beta-hydroxylase-immunoreactivity in other species shows that all teleosts studied to date have noradrenergic cells in the locus coeruleus and the caudal rhombencephalon
 However, Noradrenaline-immunoreactive(NAi) cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) -contacting paraventricular organ(PVO) cells have been described only in the teleost Gnathonemus petersii and the lizard Gekko gecko (Smeets and Steinbusch: J
 It is possible that they might pick up catecholamines as well as serotonin from the cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) , into which monoamines might be released by telencephalic and preoptic subependymal axonal plexuses
 Compared with workers, they all have large eyes, relatively larger optic lobes, smaller mushroom bodies, and similarly sized antennal lobes
 The input regions of the mushroom bodies, the lip and the collar, generally correlate with the size of the optic and antennal lobe, respectively
 For instance, the lateroposterior nucleus and pulvinar (LP-PUL) mostly contained thick axons that contributed clusters of large-sized varicosities, each forming multiple asymmetric synapses, usually with vesicle-filled dendrites
 Because the caudate nucleus does not project to the thalamus, this labeling had to arise from a neuronal population with branching axons to both structures
 Previous findings pointed to three possible sources: brainstem monoaminergic cells, intralaminar thalamic neurons, and corticostriatal cells
 Therefore, we concluded that the thalamic anterograde labeling originated from corticostriatal neurons, with axons branching to the thalamus
 A systematic representation of the contralateral body surface was found in lateral parietal cortex adjoining the first somatosensory representation, SmI (Sur et al
 The representation of the body in SmII was found to be much less distorted than in SmI
" This orientation allows SmII and SmI to be adjoined along a common border representing the top of the head and face
 After iontophoretic deposits of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) in the area of the rostral ventral respiratory group(rVRG) , many biotinylated dextran amine(BDA) -labeled terminals in the ventral horn of cervical spinal cord (C4-C5) were immunoreactive for enkephalin and vesicular glutamate transporter-2(VGLUT2) 
 Thus, we have studied the membrane availability and intraneuronal distribution of the m2 muscarinic autoreceptor (m2R) in cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) projecting to the frontal cortex (FC)
 The cerebello-pulvinar fibers were found to arise mainly from the parvicellular region of the lateral cerebellar nucleus and to terminate contralaterally in a narrow area at the extreme dorsolateral edge of the pulvinar nucleus(Pul) at the level of the stereotaxic frontal plane A-7
 The area of terminal ramification of retino-pulvinar fibers was seen as a thin sheet lying at the extreme lateral edge of the pulvinar nucleus(Pul) through most of the rostrocaudal extent of the pulvinar nucleus(Pul) , bilaterally with contralateral predominance
 The cerebellorecipient area in the pulvinar nucleus(Pul) did not seem to overlap with the retinorecipient pulvinar nucleus(Pul) area; the former appeared to be contiguous ventrolaterally to the latter
 Collectively, these findings indicate that glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the zebrafish olfactory bulb(OB) and that ionotropic glutamate receptor(iGluR) subtypes function heterogeneously in the bulbar neurons
Pyramidal neurons in the mouse SmI cortex were labeled by the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) injected into the ipsilateral MsI cortex
 To avoid confusion, terminals in SmI cortex labeled by the anterograde transport of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) injected into MsI were eliminated by lesion-induced degeneration
 Although the descending projections were bilateral with an ipsilateral dominance, trigeminal sensory nuclear complex(TSNC) received a more dominant ipsilateral projection than spinal dorsal horn(SpDH) 
 The ipsilateral portion of the nucleus nervi oculomotorii, which is located in the rostral ventral tegmentum mesencephali, supplies the musculi recti inferior and medialis and the musculus obliquus inferior without a clear somatotopic representation of the motoneurons
 The nucleus nervi trochlearis, which rostrally joins the nucleus nervi oculomotorii with a gap of only about 40 micron between the nuclei, is situated completely contralateral to the musculus obliquus superior supplied by it
 Dendrites of the nucleus nervi oculumotorii and of the nucleus accessorius nervi abducentis extend into neuropil areas receiving primary sensory afferents
Adult rat spinal and brainstem motoneurons re-express low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (p75) after their axotomy
 Results of these previous studies differed regarding the type of the most effective triggering injury for p75 reexpression, the relative duration of this reexpression and the decrease of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity (-IR) following a permanent axotomy of spinal or brainstem motoneurons
 This evidence indicates that spinal and brainstem motoneurons respond to a permanent axotomy with a different modulation of p75 and choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) expression
 In colchicine-treated turtles and pigeons, numerous calcitonin-gene-related peptide(CGRP) + perikarya were observed in the auditory relay nucleus of the thalamus (n
 Injections of fluorogold into the auditory cortex combined with immunofluorescence labeling for calcitonin-gene-related peptide(CGRP) revealed that calcitonin-gene-related peptide(CGRP) + cells in these areas do, in fact, project to the auditory cortices
 These include the possibility that auditory thalamic projections to the telencephalon arose independently in the lines of evolution leading to mammals and sauropsids
 Dual immunostaining for Fluoro-Gold (FG) and ER alpha or Fluoro-Gold(FG) and androgen receptors(AR) showed that over one-third of medial preoptic(MPO) efferents to the periaqueductal gray(PAG) contain receptors for either estrogen or androgen
 In addition, approximately 50% of periaqueductal gray(PAG) neurons retrogradely labeled from the nucleus paragigantocellularis(nPGi) were immunoreactive for either ER alpha or androgen receptors(AR) 
 An analysis of the results demonstrates that the projection to the midline cortex arises in the medial neurons within the caudal two-thirds of the basolateral nucleus
 This projection is directed to the anterior cingulate cortex, but not to the posterior cingulate cortex
 The primary motor cortex receives a basolateral amygdala projection which originates from neurons in two areas, (1) the medial part of the anterior one-third of the nucleus and (2) the center (in the lateral to medial axis) portion of the posterior two-thirds of the nucleus
 These results demonstrate that the basolateral nucleus gives rise to a rather widespread and topographically organized projection to the anterior half of the neocortex of the rat
 Some of the fine fibers in the medial lateral cervical nucleus(LCN) appeared to be collaterals of thicker fibers that terminated in the lateral lateral cervical nucleus(LCN) 
 The labeling was more sparse than that observed in the medial lateral cervical nucleus(LCN) after larger dorsal horn injections but displayed the same morphological characteristics
 The Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) observations were corroborated by the presence of many retrogradely labeled lamina I cells at both cervical and lumbar spinal levels, following injections of cholera toxin subunit b or rhodamine-labeled microspheres in the medial lateral cervical nucleus(LCN) 
 These observations indicate that the medial part of the lateral cervical nucleus(LCN) receives input from lamina I neurons, and probably from lamina III-V neurons as well, at cervical and lumbar spinal levels
 The lamina I input could also be responsible for the general inhibition of lateral lateral cervical nucleus(LCN) neurons by wide-field noxious stimulation, via activation of GABAergic interneurons in the medial lateral cervical nucleus(LCN) 
 This study examined the morphology of individual retinogeniculate terminals that were filled with horseradish peroxidase by injections in the optic tract or optic tectum
 These immunoreactive cells move outside the olfactory organ to form the ganglion of the nervus terminalis
 This may be exerted by neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus(PVH) with spinal projections
 In this study, we have analyzed the distribution of spinal cord-projecting paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus(PVH) neurons that express vasopressin, an important neuropeptide in autonomic regulation
 More than 40% of the spinally projecting neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus(PVH) of naive Sprague-Dawley rats were found to express vasopressin mRNA
 The magnocellular subdivisions displayed large numbers of vasopressin mRNA-expressing neurons, but very few of those projected to the spinal cord
 The dorsal parvocellular subdivision contained a large number of spinally projecting neurons, but very few of those expressed vasopressin mRNA
 This provides an anatomical basis for a selective activation of functionally different groups in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus(PVH) as part of a behaviorally adaptive response, including modulation of autonomic activity and pain processing at the spinal level
Brain sections cut parallel to the cortical surface revealed myelin-light septa that isolated representations of the digits and parts of the face, teeth, and tongue in area 3b of adult and infant macaque monkeys
A system of periodic intrinsic connections is demonstrated in area V2 (area 18) of squirrel and macaque monkeys by large injections of tritiated amino acids, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and fluorescent latex beads
 As in V1, the tangential configuration of these connections in V2 is reticular or latticelike, and is detectable for 2
 Other extrinsic connections, however, such as backgoing connections from V2 to V1, do not seem to have a periodic distribution
 Retrograde tracer deposits into the visual recipient zone of the caudate nucleus reveal substantial convergence of other cortical inputs to this same domain
 Aspects of visuotopic organization are preserved in the visual projections to both the putamen and the caudate nucleus, but unequivocal retinotopic organization could not be inferred from the available material
 Ten of the eleven extrastriate visual area also project topographically onto the visual zone of the claustrum
"Omnipause" neurons (OPNs), located in the nucleus raphe pontis and the reticular formation, actively suppress saccadic eye movements during intersaccadic intervals
 To determine the brainstem afferents that may inhibit the OPNs and thereby allow a saccade to occur, we injected horseradish peroxidase into the raphe pontis of four cats at the site of physiologically identified OPNs
 A few neurons were labeled in a restricted region of the causal part of the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi and in the nucleus reticularis medullaris ventralis
 Larger numbers of neurons were labeled in the dorsal column nuclei and in parts of the cochlear nuclei
 The best prospects for a saccade initiation signal from one of the labeled populations appear to be the meso-diencephalic reticular formation and/or the superior colliculus
 In the present study, we investigated the expression profiles and activity levels of ligands and receptors of the Transforming growth factor-beta(TGF-beta) and bone morphogenetic protein(BMP) 4 family during the physiological programmed cell death(PCD) periods of the developing chick and mouse retina and possible interactions of both proapoptotic molecules in mediating apoptosis in chick and murine retinal whole-mount cultures
 Retrograde transganglionic transport of HRP revealed somatotopy within the brainstem facial lobe: the delicate nerve fibres innervating the chemosensory anterior dorsal fin terminate exclusively in a distinct, dorsal portion of the facial lobe
Antisera to GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase) and GABA were used to determine the distribution of GABAergic cells and terminals in the brainstem and midbrain auditory nuclei of the barn owl
 In the time pathway, all the cells of the cochlear nucleus magnocellularis and nucleus laminaris receive perisomatic GABAergic terminals, and small numbers of GABAergic neurons surround both nuclei
Temporal lobe epilepsy is often associated with pathological changes in the dentate gyrus, and such changes may be more common in humans than in some nonprimate species
 These noradrenergic projection neurons were located not only in the locus ceruleus (8%) but also in the lateral tegmentum, including the A5 (4%) and A7 (2%) cell groups
We examined the morphology and distribution of retrogradely labeled spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons in lamina I (the marginal zone) of the spinal dorsal horn after large injections of cholera toxin subunit B (CTb) or Fast Blue (FB) into the contralateral thalamus of cats
Degeneration experiments reveal that the vestibular nerve of the adult opossum distributes to an extensive and diverse area of the brainstem and, as in placental mammals, the traditionally named nuclei do not receive a uniform distribution of primary afferent fibers
The growth of regenerating retinal axons into the central portion of the optic tectum of adult goldfish was examined with the light and electron microscopes
 Regenerating axons appear in very large numbers and travel in fascicles in the stratum opticum (SO) and in the adjacent neuropil, the stratum fibrosum et griseum superficiale (SFGS)
 The course of the accessory optic tract (AOT) and the retinal projection to the terminal nuclei are described in the gibbon and compared to that of other mammals
 In contrast to previous reports in haplorhine primates, which describe the accessory optic system(AOS) as consisting of only the dorsal (DTN) and the lateral (LTN) terminal nuclei, we find that in the gibbon, three cellular groups receive a bilateral projection, predominantly from the contralateral retina
 According to cytoarchitecture and topographic location, two of these nuclei correspond to the DTN and the LTN
 There was no evidence for a ventral division of the medial terminal nucleus(MTN) , which in nonprimates is typically situated at the ventromedial base of the cerebral peduncle
 Examination of brain morphology in primates suggests that the ventral division of the medial terminal nucleus(MTN) has been displaced from its phylogenetically stable location in the medial part of the ventral midbrain to a more dorsal position
 Nucleus basalis projects upon a belt of neurons within the overlying neostriatum
 NCT projects, in turn, upon a region of archistriatum intermedium containing cell bodies of the occipito-mesencephalic tract
7) in the thalamus and hypothalamus of the rat were studied by means of a pharmaco-histochemical technique involving staining for acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) (Karnovsky-Roots' procedure) at various times after administration of bis-(u-methylethyl)phosphorofluoridate
 The strongest acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) activity occurring at the level of the thalamus is found within the small, round to oval, somata of nucleus anterior dorsalis
 Most of the intralaminar nuclei, as well as nucleus reticularis, are composed of medium-sized multipolar neurons displaying moderate to strong acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) activity
 Moderately stained acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) neurons are also found in pars ventralis of nucleus geniculatus lateralis and in pars lateralis of nucleus habenularis
 At the level of the hypothalamus, the neurons of nuclei supraoptics and paraventricularis show strong acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) activity
 The acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) neurons of nucleus supraopticus are surrounded by numerous acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) -containing processes of some large lateral preoptic area neurons that stain intensely for the enzyme
 Retrograde tracing, with either horse-radish peroxidase or rhodamine-labelled microspheres, indicated a significant increase in the number of neurons projecting to the rostral striatum from the dorsal raphe nucleus of lesioned animals
 The increase was largely confined to the rostral extent of the dorsal raphe, and overlapped the distribution of cells labelled after injections of HRP into caudal striatum of control and lesioned animals
 These findings demonstrate that removal of dopamine(DA) afferents during development leads to an enlargement of the serotoninergic projection from the raphe nucleus to the striatum
 Specifically, trkB and neurotrophin-3(NT-3) mRNA elevations were restricted to granule cells in the ipsilateral dentate gyrus, whereas bilateral increases in trkC, brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) , and nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA levels occurred in granule cells and hippocampal pyramidal cells
 Golgi-impregnated, linearized hippocampi were sectioned serially in one of the three hippocampal planes
 Three days after treatment, a significant dose-dependent increase in Hsp27-immunoreactive protoplasmic astrocytes was found in the cingulate, frontal, occipital, and pyriform cortex, and in the hippocampus CA1
 The largest portion of the posterior cingulate gyrus is located dorsal to the corpus callosum
 We have now identified a novel third population of olfactory marker protein-expressing sensory neurons that is located in a discrete pocket of the rostral nasal septum, which we refer to as the septal organ of Grüneberg (SOG)
 Despite their unusual location, axons projecting from the septal organ of Grüneberg(SOG) neurons fasciculate into several discrete bundles and terminate in a subset of main olfactory bulb glomeruli
The connections of the cerebellar cortex with vestibular premotor neurons of the oculomotor and collimotor systems in the pigeon were delineated in experiments using WGA-HRP as an anterograde and retrograde tracer
 The retrograde data indicate that ipsilateral projections upon oculomotor neurons arise from the medial portions of the superior (VeS) and tangential (Ta) nuclei
 Projections upon neck premotor neurons arise primarily from neurons in the interstitial region of the vestibular nuclear complex
 With the exception of VDL, vestibular nuclei projecting to neck motoneurons also project to extraocular motoneurons
 Exposure to 3H-TdR given at E36 labels a few neurons in the deepest layers of the entorhinal area, and 3H-TdR given at E38 labels a small number of neurons in all hippocampal subdivisions
Postmitotic neurons migrate from a zone(s) near the ventricles to the neocortex
 The number of glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) -positive cells in the cortical plate increased steadily with time so that, by P26, glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) -immunoreactive astrocytes were distributed evenly through all cortical laminae
 The distribution of the retinal efferents to the optic tectum is unique in the flatfish
 In the middle part of the tectum, two bands of degeneration remained over the stratum griseum et fibrosum superficiale(sgfs) 
 Distinct layer was lacking in the medial tectum with a conspicuously absent large cell layer in the stratum griseum centrale (sgc)
 Using measurements of cortical thickness and surface area, the total number of cells in the striate cortex of one hemisphere was derived for each glial cell type
 These changes, however, were only a response to a substantial overshoot in cortical volume at six months: the total number of astrocytes in the striate cortex did not change
Olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) axonal extension and targeting occur within the olfactory nerve layer (ONL) of the olfactory bulb (OB)
 The data demonstrate that, as Olfactory sensory neuron(OSN) axons begin to exit the olfactory nerve layer(ONL) o and target a specific region of the olfactory bulb(OB) , there is a down-regulation of cytoskeletal elements and bound extracellular adhesion molecules
 These islands of Calleja complex(ICC) units change progressively in cytoarchitecture from the lateral to the medial edge of the olfactory tubercle
 The first two unit types display prominently two additional components of the feline islands of Calleja complex(ICC) -namely, clusters of dwarf cells and small pyramidal-like neurons constituting the densocellular layer cupping the base of lateral Callejal islands
 In the accumbal islands of Calleja complex(ICC) , satellite neurons are most conspicuous in granule-cell-poor spaces within the isla magna, where many non-granular neurons are uncharacteristically small and chromophobic
 The isla magna itself is unusual not only for its large size but for lateral extensions encircling a group of accumbal neurons far caudally
 Such extensions are one of several indications that the isla magna is intimately associated with the nucleus accumbens
Hair cell regeneration is well documented in the inner ear sensory epithelia of lower vertebrates and birds and may occur in the vestibular organs of mammals
 The subdivisions of the sciatic nerve, the sural, lateral sural, superficial peroneal, and tibial nerves each projected to a separate and distinct region of the superficial dorsal horn and collectively formed a "U"-shaped zone of terminal labeling extending from lumbar spinal segments L2 to the caudal portions of L5
 In the larval and adult retina, both melanopsins are expressed in a subset of cells in the inner retina, resembling amacrine and ganglion cells
 The Golgi impregnated neurons in inferior and lateral pulvinar are typical of other thalamic nuclei and are not qualitatively different in the two subdivisions
The distributions of orphanin FQ (OFQ/N; also known as nociceptin) and its cognate receptor, opioid receptor-like receptor-1 (NOP), overlap steroid-responsive regions throughout reproductive circuits of the limbic system and hypothalamus
 We studied estrogen and progesterone regulation of OFQ/N and NOP mRNA expression in limbic-hypothalamic reproductive circuits
 In the caudal part of the posterodorsal medial amygdala, estrogen increased OFQ/N mRNA levels, and progesterone did not alter this increase, whereas, in the medial part of the medial preoptic nucleus, estrogen and progesterone were needed to increase OFQ/N mRNA levels
 Steroid regulation of OFQ/N and NOP in the medial preoptic nucleus and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus(VMH) is consistent with emerging data indicating that this opioid system regulates female reproduction
 In the lumbosacral cord all parts of the spinal gray matter were found to contain catecholamines
 In the intermediate gray the intermediolateral nucleus in thoracic and upper lumbar segments was the most heavily innervated area, followed by the medial lumbar sympathetic group, which contains the majority of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons innervating the pelvic organs
 Following a crush lesion of the facial nerve, there was no cell loss in facial nuclei of normal (C57BL/6J) adult mice, but 40% cell loss occurred in Ola mice and the survivors increased in size during the period when functional reinnervation was established
 Moreover, retina input specifies the topography of callosal projections by postnatal day (P)6
 After restricted intracortical injections of anterogradely and retrogradely transported tracers we observed that the normal, nonmirror-symmetric callosal map, as well as the anomalous, mirror-symmetric map observed in neonatally enucleated animals, are present by P6-7, just as collateral branches of simple architecture emerge from their parental axons and grow into superficial cortical layers
 Our results therefore do not support the idea that retinal input guides callosal map formation by primarily promoting the large-scale elimination of long, nontopographic branches and arbors
 Instead, they suggest that retinal input specifies the sites on the parental axons from which interstitial branches will grow to invade middle and upper cortical layers, thereby ensuring that the location of invading interstitial branches is accurately related to the topographical location of the soma that gives rise to the parental axon
The postnatal development of a population of superior colliculus projecting retinal ganglion cells with large somata in hamsters aged from postnatal day (P) 4 to adult was studied by the intracellular injection of Lucifer Yellow
 Following optic nerve transection and horseradish peroxidase(HRP) impregnation, contralateral retinal afferents show a restricted, dense core of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) label in the superficial portion of the nucleus with sparser horseradish peroxidase(HRP) label in the surround
 Ipsilateral retinal afferents arborize throughout nucleus lentiformis mesencephali(nLM) , except in the dense-core region
 Afferents from the tectum and anterior thalamus appear to arborize throughout the nucleus without discernible pattern
 In the rostral part of the subnucleus caudalis (Vc) they were confined to lamina V (caudalis type collaterals) and in the caudal part of Vc and in cervical segments they were confined to lamina III/IV (spinal-dorsal-horn-type collaterals)
 The differential laminar distribution of collateral arbors of single axons along the rostrocaudal axis distinguishes the spinal trigeminal nucleus from the spinal dorsal horn where functional types of mechanoreceptive afferents form continuous or interrupted sagittal columns of terminal arbors that do not shift dorsoventrally within segments
Axonal tracing techniques were used to study the projection from the cochlear nucleus to the superior paraolivary nucleus in guinea pigs
 Injections of Fluoro-Gold or peroxidase-labeled-WGA and HRP into the superior paraolivary nucleus labeled multipolar cells and octopus cells bilaterally in the ventral cochlear nucleus, mainly on the contralateral side
 Injections of PHAL into the ventral cochlear nucleus labeled two types of axons in the superior paraolivary nucleus
 Combined anterograde and retrograde transport of different fluorescent tracers was used to identify the projections of the cells in the superior paraolivary nucleus that receive inputs from the ventral cochlear nucleus
 The anterior neural tube was divided into several neuromeres: the mid-hindbrain sulcus became apparent first, then the portion rostral to this sulcus was subdivided into two portions by the syn-parencephalic boundary
 In the lateral septum (LS) containing the degenerating terminals of hippocamposeptal fibers transected by fimbria-fornix transection(ff-t) , a heavy reaction of lectin-labeled activated microglial cells associated with high phagocytotic activity was noticed
 Unexpectedly, after a long survival time (6 months) following fimbria-fornix transection(ff-t) , we observed an increase in microglial GSA I-B4 labeling in the medial septum(MS) 
, a strong initial reaction in the medial septum(MS) and very little microglial activation in the lateral septum(LS) , was observed after immunolesioning
 Our results indicate that the microglial reaction in the medial septum(MS) following fimbria-fornix transection(ff-t) differs substantially from that seen in other models of axotomy
 Ultrastructural studies of hair cells and nerve terminals in the auditory receptor organ, the basilar papilla, were carried out with transmission and scanning electron microscopes
 The projections of dorsolateral visual area(DL) were determined by the intra-axonal transport of 3H-proline, 3H-acetyl-wheat germ agglutinin, and horseradish peroxidase after cortical injections
 Single injections in dorsolateral visual area(DL) sometimes produced label in two separate regions in the caudal inferior temporal cortex, suggesting that functional subdivisions exist in this projection zone
 A major feedback projection of dorsolateral visual area(DL) was to V-II
 One branch crossed the midline to project to the spinal cord, and the other, thinner branch descended caudally in the ipsilateral medullary reticular formation without distributing any terminals
 The axon of the second type projected to the contralateral spinal cord and distributed collateral branches with terminal boutons in the ipsilateral ventral respiratory group (VRG)
 The third type projected to the contralateral spinal cord and distributed terminal boutons in the medial part of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and its vicinity
 The fourth type distributed numerous branches with terminal boutons in and around the ventral part of the nucleus of the solitary tract(NTS) and the ventral respiratory group(VRG) area
 Only a small proportion of tyrosine hydroxylase-like immunoreactive neurons in the periaqueductal gray, rostral linear nucleus, and rostrodorsal ventral tegmental area contained NADPH diaphorase activity
 The other cell type was a bistratified cell with processes in both stratum 1 (s1) and stratum 4 (s4)
 Computer-assisted analysis confirmed the location of substance P-containing processes at 5-15% ( stratum 1(s1) ) and 50-70% ( stratum 4(s4) ) depth levels in the inner plexiform layer
 Whereas immunoreactivity was conspicuous in the ganglia of nervus terminalis (NT; or nucleus olfactoretinalis), a weak reaction was detected in some granule cells in the olfactory bulb and in the cells of area ventralis telencephali pars lateralis (Vl)
 In normal frontal sections of the medulla oblongata, five columns of fibers surrounded by neuronal cell bodies could be clearly distinguished, but the number is probably fortuitous, for there was no one-on-one relationship with the five trigeminal ganglia
 In addition, a dense bundle of long varicose processes projecting rostrocaudally was observed coursing along the ventral surface of the brain from the midtelencephalon to the medulla oblongata
 Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of frog brain, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord extracts revealed that, in all three regions, Urotensin II(UII) -immunoreactive material eluted as a single peak which exhibited the same retention time as synthetic frog Urotensin II(UII) 
 Intense or moderate expression of mGluR4 mRNA was detected in the granule cells of the olfactory bulb and cerebellum, whereas no significant expression of mGluR7 mRNA was found in these cells
 We examined this idea further by comparing the pattern of cytochrome oxidase(CO) stripes with the distribution of neurons in V2 that project to the superior colliculus
 Visually evoked activity in the superior colliculus is known to be greatly reduced by blocking magnocellular but not parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)
 The spinothalamic input was directed mostly to the ventral posterior complex and cells just caudal to it
 To verify this apparent dependence of parvalbumin(Parv) expression on Purkinje cell(PC) input in the deep cerebellar nuclei(DCN) , the patterns of expression in five other cerebellar mutants (weaver, staggerer, leaner, nervous, and lurcher) with differing grades and chronologies of Purkinje cell(PC) loss were compared
 In staggerer mice, neurons immunopositive for parvalbumin(Parv) as well as for Calbindin D-28k(Calb) were present in outer deep cerebellar nuclei(DCN) areas, likely representing ectopic Purkinje cell(PC) s rather than deep cerebellar nuclei(DCN) neurons
 The axons of two groups of Manduca sexta allatostatin(Mas-AS) -immunoreactive neurosecretory cells in the pars lateralis form part of the nervi corporis cardiaci (NCC 1)
 Ipsilateral spinal motor neurons also appeared clustered within the spinal cord and had thicker dendrites
 Double labeling experiments indicated light and electron microscopically colocalization of mGluR7a- and mGluR8-LI in axon terminals on dendritic shafts of presumed interneurons in the superficial layer of the olfactory tubercle and layer Ia of the piriform cortex
 The results suggest that glutamate release from axon terminals of projection fibers from MOB and AOB is regulated presynaptically and differentially through mGluR2/3, mGluR7a, and/or mGluR8
 The dorsomedial(DM) nucleus also had numerous dendritic bundles extending across the midline, linking the dorsomedial(DM) nuclei bilaterally
 In additional experiments, the afferent projections to the medial and anterolateral divisions were examined, providing an anatomical description of the tonotopicity of the lower auditory nuclei
 Deposits of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) in the DPD labeled cells in each of the lower brainstem auditory nuclei that have previously been shown to project to the entire central nucleus of the inferior colliculus
 When deposits of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) were made into other frequency band representations of the inferior colliculus, in either the medial or anterolateral division, labeled cells again formed slabs in each lower nucleus
 In this study, we explore the contralateral connections that the zona incerta(ZI) has with its opposing nucleus as well as with the other nuclei of the thalamus
 Injections of biotinylated dextran or cholera toxin subunit B were made into each of the different zona incerta(ZI) sectors (rostral, dorsal, ventral, and caudal) and into intralaminar and higher order dorsal thalamic nuclei of Sprague-Dawley rats by using stereotaxic coordinates
 These patterns of labelling were confirmed after tracer injections into intralaminar and higher order nuclei; after such injections, labelling was seen in the contralateral zona incerta(ZI) 
 The typical network formed by retinal fibers in the five retinorecipient layers of tectum is illustrated in camera lucida drawings
 The youngest terminal arbors from peripheral retina were next to the path of their fascicle along the tectal periphery, connected to their fascicle by short, centrally directed extrafascicular axons
 Terminal arbors from intermediate retina occupied intermediate positions in the tectum
The projection of the entorhinal cortex (EA) to the hippocampus in the cat has been studied by electrophysiological methods
 Unit activity elicited by hippocampal stimulation was measured in the entorhinal cortex(EA) 
 Assuming that the sites of maximal AEP amplitude correspond to the location of the major synaptic inputs, it can be concluded that the active synaptic inputs arising along a latero-medial axis in the entorhinal cortex(EA) are distributed within the hippocampus according to a septotemporal axis, although with some overlap between the different projections
 Therefore it may be concluded that the hippocampus is not homogeneous with respect to the inputs from the entorhinal cortex(EA) 
 Purkinje cells in the eminentia granularis posterior (EGp) and medialis (EGm) and the medial valvula cerebelli (VCbm) are zebrin II-
 Zebrin II antigenicity is first present at 6 days postspawning (P6) in the eminentia granularis anterior(EGa) and at P8 in the corpus cerebelli(CCb) 
 Additionally, Eigenmannia has a third class of Purkinje cells, in the eminentia granularis posterior(EGp) and EGm, that never express zebrin II immunoreactivity, indicating that zebrin II expression is not an obligatory feature of Purkinje cell development in all vertebrates
The distribution of noradrenaline (NA) immunoreactivity in the forebrain and midbrain of the lizard Gekko gecko was studied by means of recently developed antibodies against noradrenaline(NA) 
 Noradrenaline-containing cell bodies are found in the hypothalamic periventricular organ and ependymal wall of the infundibular recess of the diencephalon
 Noradrenaline-immunoreactive ( noradrenaline(NA) i) fibers and varicosities are widely, but not uniformly, distributed throughout the forebrain and midbrain
 Moderately dense plexuses of noradrenaline(NA) i fibers are found in the small-celled medial cortex, the dorsal cortex, and the midbrain tectum
 The remaining forebrain and midbrain areas are generally not or only sparsely innervated by noradrenaline(NA) i fibers
 A remarkable exception is that the cells in the hypothalamic periventricular organ and ependymal wall of the infundibular recess are immunonegative for dopamine-beta-hydroxylase(DBH) 
 Degenerating pallidothalamic projections emerging from the anterior part of the pallidum formed two diffuse groups of fibers; one coursed ventromedially directly through the internal capsule without forming a lenticular fasciculus and terminated uniformly in the reticular, VA, VD, VM and the medial part of the VE
 The otehr group coursed ventrolaterally in the internal capsule and, without forming an ansa lenticularis, entered the zona incerta, swept medially through and ventral to the medial lemniscus, and terminated in the medial part of the VE and throughout the VD
 A similar pattern of Ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) R alpha-ir was seen within all cranial motor nuclei with general somatic efferent function (III, IV, motor V, VI, VII, and XII cranial nerves)
 A few Ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) R alpha-ir neurons were seen within the globus pallidus with concomitant terminal-like staining within the subthalamic nucleus
 Autonomic regions such as the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve and the interomedial lateral cell column of the thoracic spinal cord also contained Ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) R alpha-ir neurons
 Finally, the hippocampus displayed dense Ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) R alpha-ir within the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampal formation and the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus
 Afferent fibers of the IX terminate in the glossopharyngeal lobe (L-IX)
 Most afferent fibers of the X terminate in the sensory layer of the vagal lobe (L-X), in which degenerating terminals occur in some laminae
 Ascending secondary fibers from the L-VII project bilaterally to the secondary gustatory nucleus (nGS) in the isthmus region
 Descending secondary fibers from the L-VII turn caudally in the SpV
 These fibers terminate mostly in the nucleus of the SpV  and sparsely in the nFM
 The L-IX and L-X give rise to the long and short secondary paths
 The short path includes secondary fibers projecting to the motor layer of the L-X and the medullary reticular formation
The spatiotemporal distribution of cell death in the chick embryo neural tube and spinal cord (brachial region) was examined between stage (St
 One region, the dorsal pycnotic zone, was located in the most dorsal part of the spinal cord, including the neural crest, with the highest number of pycnotic cells observed at stage(St
The afferent and efferent projections of a vocal control nucleus, the oval nucleus of the hyperstriatum ventrale (HVo), were mapped out in a parrot, the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus) to determine the relationships of this nucleus to the auditory system
 HVo has also been shown to receive input from neurons in the immediately adjacent HV (Durand et al
 Thus, the focus of the present study was to elucidate relationships between HVo, its immediately adjacent surround and telencephalic auditory nuclei
 Neurons in the HV immediately medial to HVo project to a shell region around the entire nucleus
 Interestingly, elevated levels of GIRK2 protein in the Ts65Dn hippocampus and frontal cortex correlated with elevated levels of GIRK1 protein
 This suggests that heteromeric GIRK1-GIRK2 channels are overexpressed in Ts65Dn hippocampus and frontal cortex, which could impair excitatory input and modulate spike frequency and synaptic kinetics in the affected regions
 However, in the Ts65Dn mouse a strong immunofluorescent staining of GIRK2 was detected in the lacunosum molecular layer of the CA3 area of the hippocampus
 In addition, tyrosine hydroxylase containing dopaminergic neurons that coexpress GIRK2 were more numerous in the substantia nigra compacta and ventral tegmental area in the Ts65Dn compared to diploid controls
 Double-label retrograde transport techniques were used to label cells projecting to area 17 with one fluorescent dye and to label cells projecting to posteromedial lateral suprasylvian(PMLS) cortex with a different dye
 Following injections into the two cortical areas, some cells were double labeled and some were single labeled in all three thalamic nuclei studied
 However, the relative number of double- and single-labeled cells, as well as the relative number of cells single-labeled following injections into each cortical area, differed among the three thalamic nuclei
 In both medial interlaminar nucleus(MIN) and the C-laminae of the LGNd, the number of double-labeled cells was small
 In contrast, a relatively large number of cells were single labeled with the dye placed in area 17, especially in the C-laminae of the LGNd
 In lateral posterior nucleus(LPl) , many cells were labeled after the cortical injections
 This indicates that almost all lateral posterior nucleus(LPl) cells that project to one cortical area also project to the other via a bifurcating axon
 Cochlear terminals of the three spontaneous rate(SR) groups differ in caliber and synaptic position around the inner hair cell (Liberman [1982b] Science 216:1239-1241); central terminals differ in degree of branching and in which subregions of the cochlear nucleus (CN) are targeted (Liberman [1991] J
 In areas 32 and 25, three defined bands of diffuse nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate(NADPH) diaphorase staining were located in layer 2 and in upper and deep layer 5
 From cortical thickness data and neuronal N(V) estimates, the absolute number of neurones under 1 mm2 of cortical surface (N(C)) have been derived
The reorganizations of the overall intrinsic glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic hippocampal networks as well as the time course of these reorganizations during development of pilocarpine-induced temporal lobe epilepsy were studied with in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry experiments for the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) and the vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) transporter (VGAT)
 This is illustrated by a recovery of vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGLUT1) immunoreactivity in the inner molecular layer and an increased vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGLUT1) immunolabeling in the CA1-CA3 dendritic layers
The afferent connections to the Wulst, a well-defined bulge in the forebrain roof, were studied in the pigeon
 The results demonstrate a bilateral intratelencephalic pathway arising from the archistriatum intermedium (Ai) in the basal forebrain
 dorsolateralis posterior</BrainRegion> (DLP) on both sides of the brain, provide anatomical evidence for a bilateral forebrain projection of the somatosensory thalamus
 annularis</BrainRegion> (Anl), locus coeruleus (LoC), and the avian homologue of the raphe nucleus, <BrainRegion>n
 Most of the axons in the medial and vertical lobes of adult cockroach mushroom bodies derive from class I Kenyon cells and are organized into regular, alternating pairs (doublets) of pale and dark laminae
The pattern of projections of peripheral receptors to the neocortex in the second somesthetic receiving area (SII) was mapped in raccoons
 The purpose was to determine if the projection area of peripheral receptors to the forepaw area in the somesthetic receiving area(SII) region is disproportionally enlarged as it is in SI
 The forepaw area in somesthetic receiving area(SII) shows an enlargement commensurate with that found in the SI
 This suggests that those factors that are selective for tactile acuity of the raccoon forepaw were operating in the evolution of somesthetic receiving area(SII) as they were in SI
 The somatotopic organization of mechanoreceptive projections to somesthetic receiving area(SII) is reversed mediolaterally compared to previous descriptions of this arrangement in other mammals: projections form axial structures lie medially and those from apical structures lie laterally along the inferior bank of the suprasylvian sulcus in the raccoon
 Horseradish peroxidase (HRP), fluorescein-, or Texas red-(TRDA) coupled dextran-amine applied into the oculomotor nucleus of larval lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) retrogradely labeled two populations of contralateral abducens interneurons, one lateral and the other periventricular
 Tracer application to the abducens nucleus anterogradely labeled thick contralateral fibers that specifically contact the medial rectus motor subnucleus by means of large boutons
 This lateral rectus (abducens) -- medial rectus (oculomotor) internuclear projection of lampreys appears to be similar to those involved in the coordination of horizontal eye movements in mammals
 The periventricular abducens interneurons projected bilaterally to other oculomotor subnuclei
 Tracer application to the abducens nucleus labeled a group of small interneurons in the ipsilateral dorsal rectus motor subnucleus
 These data indicate that, in these deprived cats, there is little or no cortical development for visual orienting, but cortex is necessary for visual discrimination learning
 The distribution of these immunoreactive fibers in the fimbria and lateral septal nucleus is most consistent with an anteriorly directed efferent hippocampal pathway
Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) in a slow-release polyacrylamide gel pellet was implanted in the medulla or spinal cord of the rat
 Large numbers of retrogradely labeled cells were visualized by immunocytochemical procedures in specific nuclei of the forebrain mainly ipsilateral to the implant site following implants as far caudal as the sacral segments of the spinal cord
 Total average number of labeled forebrain cells (three brains per category; 100 micron per 150 micron of brain tissue were examined microscopically): medulla, 2,115; cervical, 1,878; lumbar, 1,017; sacral, 385
 Labeled cells were also seen in the medial basal hypothalamus and the rostral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis
 Therefore, we interpret the paucity or absence of labeled cells in particular brain regions to indicate that cells of these regions do not project to the medulla or spinal cord
 These results suggest that the roles of L1 and TAG-1 in the formation of the commissures in the forebrain are different from their roles in the spinal cord
 Anterogradely labeled fibers in the mamillotegmental tract diverged from the principal mamillary tract in an extensive dorsocaudally oriented swath of axons which extended to the dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei, and numerous axons turned sharply ventrally and rostrally to terminate topographically in the dorsomedial nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis and rostromedial pontine nuclei
 These findings indicate that neurons in the dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei are reciprocally connected with mamillary body(MB) projection neurons
 We compared the expression patterns of these pallial marker genes with that of the subpallial gene xDistal-less-4 (xDll4)
 Our results indicate that the whole pallium of Xenopus expresses the T-box genes XenopusTbr1(xTbr1) and xEomes (in proliferating cells and/or mantle) during embryonic and larval development, and the expression of these genes is topographically complementary to that of xDistal-less-4(xDll4) in the subpallium
 On the other hand, during development xEmx1 is expressed in a large part of the pallium (proliferating and postmitotic cells) except for an area adjacent to the pallio-subpallial boundary, where xEmx1 is observed only in some mantle cells
 In contrast, the caudal part of the previously termed lateral amygdalar nucleus shows strong xEmx1 expression and may be a lateral pallial derivative
 Finally, expression of XenopusTbr1(xTbr1) , xEomes, and xEmx1 is observed in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb from early developmental stages, further supporting that this structure is a pallial derivative
 A total of 2,736 wheat germ-agglutinated horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) -stained neurons were located within the ipsilateral superior colliculus (SC), and a few labeled cells were consistently found bilaterally in the external nuclei of the inferior colliculus
 Nor was the suprageniculate nucleus(Sg) injection site location related to the laminar distribution of superior colliculus(SC) projection neurons
 Immunoreactive cells with dendrite- and axonlike processes were observed also in the parapineal organ and the habenular nucleus
 326:375-401, '92), while the other cortical areas mentioned also have direct projections to the structures of the inner cortical vestibular circuit
 One hundred nine dendrites from six ventral posterolateral (VPL) neurons and six ventral posteromedial (VPM) neurons were examined
 The mean path distance (length from soma to a dendritic tip) was very similar for all dendrites in each group ( ventral posterolateral(VPL) or ventral posteromedial(VPM) ) regardless of the number of branches found along the path distance
In the visual system of the cat the projection from the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus has been studied extensively
 Retinogeniculate axons and lateral geniculate neurons are labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) via injections into the optic tracts and optic radiations, respectively
 They are examined with the light microscope to identify labeled lateral geniculate neurons that appear to be contacted by labeled retinal axons
 This light microscopic analysis indicates that individual class 1 cells are contacted by many retinogeniculate axons (&amp;gt; 10) and that each of these axons contacts many lateral geniculate neurons (&amp;gt; 20)
 Thus, intrinsic choroidal neurons may represent peripherally displaced pterygopalatine ganglion neurons forming a local network for regulation of vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle tone in the duck choroid
 The morphologic and synaptic features of neurons in the rat caudal nucleus tractus solitarius(NTS) were assessed using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and biocytin labeling in brainstem slices
 The osseous capsula of the ear has two foramina other than the nerve foramina
 Eighth nerve projections to the valvula cerebelli are less prominent than the projections from the lateral line
 Eighth nerve and lateral line nerve efferents arise from a common nucleus, the octavolateralis efferent nucleus
 Axons of efferent cells may divide to supply two or more branches of the eighth nerve and some axons supply both lateral line and eighth nerve endorgans
To further address the hypothesis that cholecystokinin (CCK) in the medullary dorsal horn (MDH) arises from intrinsic or higher-order neurons, cholecystokinin(CCK) -8-specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) and immunohistochemical (IHC) experiments were carried out in adult rats after trigeminal tractotomy
 radioimmunoassay(RIA) and immunohistochemical(IHC) methods were also used to assess medullary dorsal horn(MDH) cholecystokinin(CCK) concentrations in adult rats subjected to left infraorbital nerve section at birth
 The left medulla contained significantly higher levels of cholecystokinin(CCK) than the control right medulla (1
 To determine if the neonatal lesion-induced increase in medullary cholecystokinin(CCK) is due to primary afferent or higher-order reorganization, radioimmunoassay(RIA) and immunohistochemical(IHC) experiments were run after infraorbital nerve section at birth and trigeminal tractotomy in adulthood
 In C6 it forms a dorsoventrally oriented narrow region at the lateral border of the ventral horn; in C7 and rostral C8 it forms a broad column in the dorsolateral corner of the ventral horn
 Their axons invade the telencephalon on fetal day 16 and run in the intermediate zone just below the cortical plate, reaching the visual area of fetal day 18
 In the transverse axis, neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive cells seemed to follow a faint suprapyramidal to infrapyramidal gradient, which was due to differential timing of neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive cells destined for the stratum infragranulosum of the suprapyramidal and infrapyramidal blades of the fascia dentata
 Northern analysis of reelin mRNA from normal rats showed that rat reelin was expressed as a approximately 12-kb transcript in both the cerebrum and the cerebellum, whereas reelin expression was markedly reduced in the shaking rat Kawasaki(SRK) brains
 In situ hybridization analysis showed that reelin mRNA in the shaking rat Kawasaki(SRK) brains was expressed in Cajal-Retzius cells in the marginal zone of the cerebral cortex and outer granular cells in the cerebellar cortex in similar manners to normal controls, but its expression was considerably reduced
 On Western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses using antibodies specific for the Reelin protein, no immunoproduct was recognized in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices
 Two groups of adrenergic cells, which are equivalent to those of other species, were detected: Group C1 in the ventrolateral medulla and group C2 in the dorsomedial medulla
 In group C2, some immunoreactive cell bodies smaller than those in C1 and many nerve terminals are found in the motor nucleus of the vagus, but most of the adrenergic cells and fibers are observed in the nucleus tractus solitarii
 Our data give new information about the adrenergic system in the medulla oblongata, especially in the nucleus tractus solitarii of the tree shrew, a species that provides a useful model of a small primate brain
The superior olivary complex is a major source of auditory projections to the inferior colliculus
 Although the projections from the medial and lateral superior olivary nuclei have been well characterized, projections from the surrounding periolivary nuclei have received relatively little attention
 The lateral, dorsal, and medial periolivary groups project bilaterally, and the ventral periolivary group projects ipsilaterally
 The remaining periolivary nuclei project only ipsilaterally or contain separate populations of cells that project to the two inferior colliculi
The distribution and morphology of Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive (NPY-ir) neurons in the olfactory bulb and the olfactory peduncle was studied in the adult cat and rat, and the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus
 In all three species, the population of Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive(NPY-ir) neurons is localized in the white matter extending from the main olfactory bulb to the border of the striatum
 The former, ipsilateral projection terminates in the granule cell layer of the main and accessory olfactory bulb and in layer II/III of the anterior olfactory nucleus
 Reconstruction of the latter projection has revealed that the fibers are continuous with the olfactory limb of the anterior commissure and the anterior commissure proper suggesting a commissural contralateral projection
 Later in development the fiber density in the olfactory limb and the anterior commissure becomes considerably reduced
 In contrast, the plexus density in the anterior olfactory nucleus and the granule cell layer of the main and accessory olfactory bulb undergoes only a slight reduction, and the Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive(NPY-ir) cell number remains roughly constant
 We found that novel projections from the intact ventral cochlear nucleus(VCN) to ipsilateral medial nucleus of the trapezoid body(MNTB) emerge after lesions performed as late as postnatal day 25
 Foliation patterns correlate with the expansion of the cerebellar layers and of total cerebellar area
 Furthermore, the temporal-to-septal axis of origin in the septal two-thirds of the subiculum corresponded to a ventrolateral-to-dorsomedial axis of termination in the medial mammillary nucleus
 These results suggest that different populations of neurons existing along the longitudinal axis of the subiculum may exert their influences on the execution of different hypothalamic functions
 The habenular nuclei also appear to project to the central nucleus of the amygdala
 Neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and superior colliculus (SC) were generated at P1-P10 and P1-P18 respectively
 Peak numbers of labelled cells were seen at P3 and P5 in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus(dLGN) and superior colliculus(SC) 
 Cell death was assessed in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus(dLGN) and superior colliculus(SC) of young aged P10-P150
 With further development, the retinal basal lamina was not reestablished; newly developing neuroepithelium in the peripheral retina, however, generated an intact basal lamina
 The present data demonstrate that the retinal basal lamina, by anchoring the neuroepithelial cells to the pial surface of the retina, has an important function in the development of the normal cytoarchitecture of this structure
We have investigated the target dependence of hypoglossal motor neurons in postnatal rats by transecting the hypoglossal nerve and preventing reinnervation of the tongue
 Moreover, many of the dendrites in this nucleus of the solitary tract(NTS) region express both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and serotonin (5HT) 2A receptors, and some of these dendrites may arise from the adjacent dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus(DMNV) 
The neurogenetic gradients of neurons showing glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) immunoreactivity were determined in the regio superior and in the regio inferior of the mouse hippocampus
 Radial gradients of neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive cells are characterized by two main features: 1) with the exception of the stratum lacunosum-moleculare and its interface with the stratum radiatum, glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive neurons of the plexiform strata are generated before those destined for the pyramidal layer; 2) within the pyramidal layer, glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive cells are positioned according to an inside-out sequence
 Given the selective laminar disposition of the GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampus, the present authors explored whether or not the diverse types of these interneurons could have specific birth dates and concluded that no relationship exists between birth dates and adult phenotypes of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -immunoreactive cells in the mouse hippocampus proper
We examined in rats the relationship between the ordering of retinal axons in the optic pathway and the formation of a retinotopically organized projection to their primary target, the contralateral superior colliculus (SC)
 We have previously found that axons labeled by focal injections of 1,1'-dioctadecyl 3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) made in temporal or nasal retina of perinatal rats commonly mistarget along the medial-lateral and rostral-caudal axes of the superior colliculus(SC) 
 In the present study, we made similar 1,1'-dioctadecyl 3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate(DiI) injections, covering less than 2% of the retinal area, in peripheral temporal, nasal, superior, or inferior retina, in rats of two age groups, embryonic day (E) 21 to P (postnatal day) 2 and P11-P17
 In retina, labeled axons travel in fascicles directly from the injection site to the optic disc, but neighbor relationships begin to degrade as fascicles split and mix
 Retinotopic order is virtually lost in the optic nerve; axons labeled from each injection site disperse throughout its cross-sectional area, but the labeled axons tend to be concentrated toward a specific half of the nerve depending upon their retinal origin
 However, the distributions of labeled retinal axons observed in whole mounts of the retina and optic pathway have a degree of disorder similar to those in E21-P2 rats
 The localization of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor subunits to neurons throughout the macaque hypothalamus provides further evidence for the glutamatergic regulation of neuroendocrine, autonomic, and limbic circuits
 Other fibers ran through the dorsal two-thirds of the external pallidum en route to the putamen
 We used steroid autoradiography to measure the ontogeny of steroid accumulation in the spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus(SNB) and the retrodorsolateral nucleus (RDLN), two motoneuronal groups thought to differ in their sensitivity to androgens
 spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus(SNB) and retrodorsolateral nucleus(RDLN) motoneurons differ in the ontogeny of androgen accumulation
 The lateral part of the medial accessory olive projects to more lateral parts of these lobules with the exception of lobule VII
 The rostral half of the medial accessory olive projects to lobule IX and to the hemisphere
 The other projections of the accessory olives and the principal olive to the hemisphere are similar to those reported for the cat
 An accessory cell group in the sheep, located between the principal and the dorsal accessory olive, has connections with the caudal vermis and the hemisphere
The goal of this study was to determine the compartmental organization of 5'-nucleotidase within the rodent ventral striatum and to compare the distribution of 5'-nucleotidase with that of leu-enkephalin, cell clusters, and infralimbic cortical innervation
 This "medial band" extends from the rostral pole of the ventral striatum to the bed nucleus of stria terminalis
 The innervation of the ventral striatum by the infralimbic cortex is denser in the shell than in the core
 Overall, the compartmental structure of 5'-nucleotidase in the ventral striatum segregates projections from different layers of the infralimbic cortex
 Application of wheat germ agglutinin horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) to the superior sagittal sinus and adjacent areas of the supratentorial dura mater labeled numerous neurons in each of the left and right superior cervical ganglia
 Also, the lateral septum(LS) was divided into dorsal, intermediate, and ventral parts ( lateral septum(LS) d, lateral septum(LS) i, and lateral septum(LS) v), and the volume and number of single-stranded DNA(ssDNA) -immunoreactive cells in each part were measured on PD6, 8, 11, 16, and 31
 There was no sex difference in volume or number of apoptotic cells in the lateral septum(LS) d or lateral septum(LS) v
 If all L and LD cells are formed at the retinal margin and first develop oriented dendrites, we have to assume that the more randomly oriented dendritic trees in the central retina have undergone a reorganization
 To find out whether a zonal pattern exists in the cerebellar cortex, a topological analysis was made of the Purkinje cell layer of a Nissl-stained series of the cerebellum
 In the experimental part of this study, the corticonuclear projections to the cerebellar nuclei and the vestibular nuclear complex were demonstrated with the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) technique
 Two strips of Purkinje cells remained unlabeled: One in the rostrolateral part of the intermediate zone, and another in the medial part of the medial zone
 After horseradish peroxidase(HRP) gel implantations in the cerebellar peduncle aimed at the medial and lateral cerebellar nuclei, respectively
 It can be concluded that cerebellar zones as demonstrated in the turtle Pseudemys scripta elegans, are phylogenetically very old and may represent the basic functional circuit of the cerebellum
In neonatal rats the unilateral transection of the cerebellar peduncles causes a fast and complete degeneration of the contralateral inferior olive
 Although its specificity was not totally maintained, the mediolateral distribution of sprouted afferents in the cerebellum matched the caudorostral disposition of parent neurons in the olive, as in the case in normal olivocerebellar projection
 Anterograde studies showed that compensatory fibers recrossing the cerebellar midline spread throughout the whole extent of the deprived cortex and terminate solely in the molecular layer as typical climbing fibers
 Peptide-like immunoreactivity was observed in axons within the optic nerve stump retinal to the crush, as in previous studies (Kuljis and Karten, '83b, Kuljis et al
 The optic nerve contralateral to the procedure displayed only occasional isolated peptide-containing fibers, as in normal optic nerves
 The retinae ipsilateral and contralateral to the crush exhibited no change in the normal pattern of peptide-like immunoreactivity, including the absence of demonstrable peptide-like immunoreactivity in the somata of retinal ganglion cells
 The patterns of leucine enkephalin(LENK) -, CCK8-, and bombesin(BOM) -like immunoreactivities in the tectum were identical to those following irreversible retinal deafferentation as long as 9 months postoperatively
The antennal lobes (ALs) are the primary olfactory centers in the insect brain
 To assign the input-output connectivity of all glomeruli, we investigated the spatial relationship of the antennal tracts and two prominent AL output tracts (medial and lateral ACT) mainly formed by uniglomerular (u) projection neurons(PNs) using fluorescent tracing, confocal microscopy, and 3D analyses
 The results revealed a clear segregation of glomeruli into two AL hemispheres specifically supplied by projection neurons(PNs) of the medial and lateral ACT
 Tracing of three mediolateral (ml) antenno-cerebral tracts(ACTs) mainly formed by multiglomerular projection neurons(PNs) revealed terminals in distinct compartments of the lateral horn(LH) and in three olfactory foci within the lateral protocerebrum
 Columns of 30-50 microns in diameter are hypothesized to be a general feature of cortical organization, but no quantitative analysis of different human cortical areas has been performed
 These zones vary in relative thickness around the circumference of the olfactory bulb; the deep zone is proportionally thicker in the most dorsal and ventral parts of the bulb
 The results show that very few, if any, thalamic neurons project to more than one area of cortex
 Rather, the prefrontal cortex is defined by multiple specific relationships with the thalamus
 Corticospinal axons are first present in the contralateral spinal gray of lower cervical cord at day 5 and in the contralateral spinal gray of lower lumbar and sacral cord by day 9
 Therefore, we sought to test the hypothesis that the cardiovascular nucleus tractus solitarii, the site of termination of arterial baroreceptor nerves, projects to pontine preganglionic neurons whose stimulation elicits cerebral vasodilatation
 The study establishes the presence of a direct monosynaptic pathway from neurons in the cardiovascular nucleus tractus solitarii to pontine preganglionic parasympathetic neurons that project to the pterygopalatine ganglia, the source of nitroxidergic vasodilatory innervation of cerebral blood vessels
4 is expressed in glial cells and not in axons in the rat spinal cord white matter and that its expression is markedly increased in cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage after chronic spinal cord injury(SCI) 
 To determine whether an equivalent adrenergic population is present in the rostroventrolateralis(RVL) of the cat, we used antibodies raised against bovine adrenal phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase(PNMT) to map the distribution of adrenaline-synthesizing neurons in the reticular formation
 The majority of labeled cells were seen in a nucleus designated rostroventrolateralis(RVL) at the level of the rostral one-third of the inferior olive
 Our results are consistent with the notion that an area of the rostroventrolateralis(RVL) containing adrenergic perikarya is the anatomical structure responsible for cardiovascular changes that occur when chemicals are applied to Schlaefke's area
 Previous work from our laboratory and others, examining synapses between neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei and neurons in the thalamus revealed ultrastructural characteristics that have been implicated in the expression of synaptic plasticity at other locations in the brain
 Mutations in the survival motor neuron(SMN) gene cause spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), an autosomal recessive disease characterized by degeneration of lower motor neurons in the spinal cord leading to progressive muscle wasting
 At this caudal level, it reaches its maximal elongation and extends from the ventral tip of the lateral ventricles to the dorsolateral aspects of the paraventricular nucleus
 Staining also appeared at specific stages in the spinal cord, the retina, and the skin
 neuropeptide Y(NPY) -neurons are generated between E14 and E20 and are found in layers II-VI of the cortex and the subcortical white matter
 The projection to M1 shared relatively limited zones of origin with the projections directed to PMvc(PM) 
 The A1 neurons of the caudal ventrolateral medulla were much more scattered than in rats or rabbits, but relatively similar to cats
 An ascending catecholaminergic fiber pathway was traced through the central tegmental field of the canine medulla and pons, with features similar to the primate
 Responses to electrical stimulation of the oculomotor complex and the vestibular nerves were characterized and selected neurons were injected with horseradish peroxidase(HRP) 
 Neurons antidromically activated by oculomotor complex stimulation were generally monosynaptically excited by the ipsilateral vestibular nerve
 Notable was the absence of strong commissural inhibition by stimulation of the contralateral vestibular nerve
 Light microscopy of antidromically identified injected cells demonstrated that these cells are predominantly located at the central levels of the superior vestibular nucleus along the incoming vestibular nerve fibers but a few are found at more caudal levels
In the avian auditory system, the neural network for computing the localization of sound in space begins with bilateral innervation of nucleus laminaris (NL) by nucleus magnocellularis (NM) neurons
 We used antibodies against the neural specific markers Hu C/D, neurofilament, and SV2 together with retrograde fluorescent dextran labeling from the contralateral hindbrain to identify nucleus magnocellularis(NM) neurons within the anlage and follow their development
 By observing the pattern of neuronal rearrangements together with the pattern of contralaterally projecting nucleus magnocellularis(NM) fibers, we could identify nucleus laminaris(NL) in the ventral anlage
 Thus, extensive pathfinding and morphological rearrangement of central auditory nuclei occurs well before the arrival of cochlear afferents
 In the first stage, each germinal cell becoming a ganglion cell extends an axon into the fibre layer of the retina and towards the optic disc, and the soma of the cell moves towards the ganglion cell layer
 The emergence of the B16 protein was also examined in retina from mice homozygous for the retinal degeneration (rd) mutation which affects photoreceptor synaptogenesis
 Application of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B (ChB) in the third ventricle resulted in uptake in ependymal axons and backfilling of perikarya in the dorsomedian part of the dorsal raphe nucleus, immediately under the caudal aqueduct
) s neither in the subcommissural organ(SCO) nor in the ependyma
 However, on embryonic day(ED) 17 we consistently found retrogradely labeled cells in the hippocampus, indicating that the development of the hippocamposeptal projection precedes that of the septohippocampal projection
 A comparative analysis of individual growth cones found in the fimbria and the hippocampus proper revealed no striking differences in their morphology
 Electron microscopic analysis showed that growth cones in the fimbria were mainly contacted by other axons, whereas growth cones in the hippocampus had contact with all available elements
 A difference matrix, formed by subtracting the metabolic activity matrix of cortex contralateral to the stimulated eye from the ipsilateral "depressed" matrix, emphasized those parts of the visual cortex that received monocular visual input
 In striate cortex, differences were maximal in the medial monocular portion, and the lateral or binocular portion was shown to be divided metabolically into a far lateral contralaterally dominant strip along the cortical representation of the vertical meridian, and a more medial region of patches of more or less contralaterally dominant binocular input
 Lateral peristriate differences were less than those of striate cortex, and regions of greater and lesser monocular input could be distinguished
 We did not detect differences between the two hemispheres in either anterior or medial peristriate areas, thus indicating either completely binocular input (which seems unlikely given the retinotopic organization of these regions), or a greater dependence than in the lateral peristriate on inputs that were not affected by the visual manipulations
7 in the entire lateral cervical nucleus(LCN) on one side of the cervical spinal cord, but this may have been an underestimation, as the penetration by the antisera was limited
 More neurons in the medial than the lateral half, and more in the caudal than the rostral half of the hypothalamus project to the mesencephalon
 In general, best elevations for afferents corresponded to hair cell orientations in the region innervated; unexpectedly low elevations obtained from afferents innervating the middle saccule may reflect curvature of the sensory epithelium against the otolith
 Variation in terminal field sites also was noted in the medial to lateral axis of the descending octaval nucleus(dDON) ; however, there were no consistent correlations between terminal field locations, physiology, and best directions of the saccular afferents
 In ventroposterolateral(VPL) of cats substance P(SP) fibers and terminals are present along its ventral and lateral border, a paralaminar area in which spinothalamic fibers have been shown to terminate and where neurons responsive to noxious stimuli have been reported
 Also in rats the substance P(SP) innervation of ventroposterolateral(VPL) is similar to that of spinothalamic tract fibers
 The presence of substance P(SP) -positive spinothalamic neurons in the spinal cord is reported in the following paper
 The development of cytoarchitectural features of the medial geniculate body(MGB) was examined in rat to identify age-related patterns of growth in major geniculate compartments that have been described previously (Clerici and Coleman [1990] J
 Golgi stains after birth reveal restricted dendritic arborizations in MGv cells and dichotomous branching patterns of MGd neurons
 Somal growth occurs between all postnatal age groups tested for ovoid(OV) , LV, and deep dorsal(DD) nuclei, although LV segments related to high and low frequencies do not differ
Retrograde and transganglionic transport of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to the B-fragment of cholera toxin (B-HRP) was used to study the location, morphology, and central projections of mesencephalic trigeminal (Me5) neurons innervating rat masticatory muscles
 Extensive central projections from labeled Me5 cells could be seen extending from the nucleus of Darkschewitsch rostrally to the C2 segment caudally
Despite the relatively unfeatured cytoarchitecture of the striatum, this large subcortical region has been found to have a modular macroscopic substructure comprising the neurochemically distinct striosomes and matrix, and, within the matrix, patchy input and output arrangements called matrisomes
 We injected medium spiny neurons in lightly fixed slices of the squirrel monkey caudate nucleus, reconstructed their dendritic arbors, and analyzed the orientations of these arbors with respect to the cardinal planes of the striatum
 We obtained comparable supplementary observations for the ferret caudate nucleus, suggesting that such spatial alignment of spiny dendritic arbors may be a general feature of striatal organization
The distribution of radiolabeled neurons in the brain stem of Lampetra fluviatilis was studied following unilateral injections of (3H)D-aspartate in the rostral spinal cord
 After survival periods of 1-3 days, labeled perikarya were present within and nearby the posterior, middle, and anterior rhombencephalic reticular nuclei and in the mesencephalic reticular nucleus
 In control Wistar rats, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide(PACAP) immunoreactivity was expressed in fibers in the superficial dorsal horn at all segmental levels examined (L1, L2, and L4-S1)
 The density of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide(PACAP) immunoreactivity was increased in the superficial laminae (I-II) of the L1, L2, L6, and S1 spinal segments
 In the squirrel, guinea pig, and hamster, mu and kappa binding is dense in the stratum lucidum of CA3 and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus
 In the other species, the delta binding pattern is generally the inverse of the mu/kappa pattern: most areas of the hippocampus are enriched in delta sites, whereas the stratum lucidum and the pyramidal cell layer are receptor-sparse
 While glucagon-immunoreactive amacrine cells were negative for substance P in central regions of the retina, a subset of this type of amacrine cell was immunoreactive for substance P in far peripheral regions of the retina
The projection of basilar pontine neurons to the cerebellar hemispheres was studied to pigmented rats by means of the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase
 The main focus of labeled neurons following lobulus simplex injections of horseradish peroxidase was located in the ventral pons, at rostral levels
 This pattern of labeling contrasts with that in cases of crus II injections, in which the main focus of labeled somata occupied more central regions of medial and ventral portions of the pons
 Combining the latter finding with the preceeding notion regarding pontocerebellar divergence suggests a mechanism by which sensorimotor information might be transmitted to several different cerebellar locations
 With light and electron microscopy, using mice, we studied the central branches of medial olivocochlear neurons that are given off to the inferior vestibular nucleus
 These results indicate that the inferior vestibular nucleus is an integrating center for vestibular, auditory, and other types of information, but the results do not fit with current theories about the function of the olivocochlear system
 Group A monkeys had horseradish peroxidase(HRP) injections or transcannular horseradish peroxidase(HRP) gel implants into the oculomotor complex (OMC), the largest of which involved adjacent paraoculomotor nuclei (e
 Group B monkeys had injections/implants into the medial pontine tegmentum and dorsomedial basilar pons
 The fastigial nucleus(FN) , basal interstitial nucleus(BIN) , and cell group Y, on the other hand, contained almost no labeling
 These cases contained the largest numbers of labeled cells in the posterior interpositus nucleus(PIN) and a lesser number in the ventrolateral fastigial nucleus(FN) 
 The so-called central nucleus also innervates the contralateral superior rectus muscle
 Projections from frontal eye fields(FEF) terminated in ventral and caudal parts of the subthalamic nucleus without a clear topography
 We observed that RL (retinal) terminals are largest, F (local, GABAergic, inhibitory) terminals are intermediate in size, and RS (cortical and brainstem) terminals are smallest
The terminal distribution of thalamic afferents in primate prefrontal cortex has never been examined in any detail
 As expected on the basis of retrograde degeneration and transport studies, injections centered in the magnocellular ( mediodorsal nucleus(MD) mc) subnucleus of mediodorsal nucleus(MD) labeled cells and terminals in the ventral and medial prefrontal cortex
 No terminal label was ever observed in layers I, II, superficial III, V, or VI in any part of the cerebral cortex following injections confined to any part of mediodorsal nucleus(MD) 
A previous study in the rat revealed that distinct orbital and medial prefrontal cortical (OMPFC) areas projected to specific columns of the midbrain periaqueductal gray region (PAG)
 This study used anterograde tracing techniques to define projections to the hypothalamus arising from the same orbital and medial prefrontal cortical(OMPFC) regions
 There were also projections to medial perifornical and lateral hypothalamic areas
 The efferent axons of the inferior olivary neurons are already present and already highly organized in the cerebellum of newborn rats
 Most of the autoradiographic labelling subsequent to the injection of 3H-leucine into the inferior olive is seen in the subcortical medullary zone
 The principal olive, ventral and dorsal lamellae, supplies climbing fiber inputs to the hemispheric cortex
 VGluT2 immunoreactivity was widely distributed in the forebrain, particularly in the diencephalon, from postnatal day 0 (P0) to adulthood, suggesting relatively early maturation of VGluT2-loaded glutamatergic axons
 Interestingly, Vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGluT1) immunoreactivity was frequently colocalized with VGluT2 immunoreactivity at single axon terminal-like profiles in layer IV of the primary somatosensory area from P5 to P10 and in the ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus from postnatal day 0(P0) to P14
 The present results indicate that VGluT2-loaded glutamatergic axons maturate earlier than Vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGluT1) -laden axons in the mouse telencephalic and diencephalic regions, and suggest that Vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGluT1) plays a transient developmental role in some glutamatergic systems that mainly use VGluT2 in the adulthood
 By immunohistochemistry, both forms of the receptor were found to be predominantly expressed in cerebral cortex and dorsal hippocampus, in keeping with earlier radioligand binding and in situ hybridization data
Gangliosides were extracted, separated by thin layer chromatography, and quantitated in three cranial nerves of the garfish (Lepisosteus osseus): the completely unmyelinated olfactory nerve (OLF), and two nerves composed of both myelinated and unmyelinated fibers, viz
 These results indicate that the ventroposterior thalamus is capable of substantial reorganization, which may account for much of the reorganization seen in somatosensory cortex
 We report here that: 1) parabrachial(PB) neurons excited chiefly by noxious stimulation of the face have their dendritic tree located primarily within the field of lamina I trigeminal projections, i
, in parabrachial(PB) mid-extent, around the borderline between the external lateral and both the lateral crescent and the superior lateral subnuclei
 Our results suggest the presence of an extensive excitatory axodendritic link between lamina I projections and parabrachial(PB) nociceptive neurons around the lateral crescent and the external medial subnuclei
This study investigates the distribution of brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein (BDNF) and its receptor, TrkB, during the development of hippocampus and cerebellum in a long-gestation species, the guinea pig
 With advancing gestational age an increase in the intensity of brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein(BDNF) -IR in granule cells was accompanied by concomitant increases in the staining and areal growth of the associated mossy fiber layer in the hippocampus, and the molecular layer in the cerebellum
 Thus, we have demonstrated in both the hippocampus and cerebellum that the spatiotemporal distribution of brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein(BDNF) -IR and TrkB-IR coincides with the maturation of granule cells prenatally and with significant periods of neuropil growth, both prenatally and in the immediate postnatal period
 The thalamo-cortical projections are as follows: The small-celled mediodorsal cortex receives a projection from nucleus dorsolateralis anterior pars magnocellularis
 The large-celled mediodorsal cortex receives projections from nucleus dorsolateralis anterior pars parvicellularis and pars magnocellularis
 The lateral cortex receives a projection from nucleus dorsolateralis anterior pars magnocellularis
 In the proximal part of the optic nerve, radial retinal lesions resulted in a sheet of degenerating axons along the rostrocaudal extent of the nerve
 In the optic chiasm, the distribution of fibers was similar to that seen in the proximal part of the optic nerve
 The ventral, nasal and temporal retinal fibers lay in the superficial part of the tract whereas the fibers from the nasal and temporal dorsal retina ran in the deeper, medial aspect of the tract
 As the tract approached the tectum degenerating fibers from single retinal lesions did not always remain together
 In the case of a lesion in the ventral nasal retina, degenerating fibers split into two bundles located at opposite ends of the tract only to reunite at their terminal regional at the caudal pole of the tectum
The organisation of the second visual area (V2) in marmoset monkeys was studied by means of extracellular recordings of responses to visual stimulation and examination of myelin- and cytochrome oxidase-stained sections
 The total surface area of V2 is approximately 100 mm2, or about 50% of the surface area of V1 in the same individuals
 Although fibers immunoreactive for calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) were identified in low density throughout the mediobasal hypothalamus, only female rats displayed prominent fiber staining in the periventricular region
 Double-labelling immunofluorescence experiments revealed that the calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) -immunoreactive cells within the zona incerta, but not the hypothalamus, were also immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase; at least 60% of the A13 dopaminergic neurons co-express calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) 
 These projections target the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus(IC) (CN inferior colliculus(IC) ) ipsilaterally and the inferior colliculus(IC) cortices bilaterally, with the ipsilateral component predominant
 The ventral secondary cortex targets midbrain periaqueductal gray
 The caudal cortex projection originates from smaller layer V pyramids and targets the inferior colliculus(IC) cortices with dense terminal fields
 Ethanol exposure had no effect on neuronal size or choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) staining intensity of medial septal(MS) or DBv neurons when compared to chow-fed offspring
Each antennal lobe in the brain of a male moth has a distinctive neuropil structure, the macroglomerular complex (MGC), which is specialized for primary processing of information about the conspecific female sex-pheromone blend
 Dendritic field sizes increase from 150 microm in the central retina to 300 microm in the retinal periphery
 In rats of these three age groups, labelled neurons were found bilaterally in the red nucleus, with a contralateral predominance, and they were found in both the parvicellular and magnocellular portions of the red nucleus
 Systematic charting also revealed smaller numbers of estrogen-concentrating cells in other specific hypothalamic and limbic locations
 Pars intermedia and the posterior lobe were virtually unlabelled
 In order to examine whether this limit was imposed by optic fibers or by target cells, optic synapses were counted in surgically halved tecta which received compressed optic projections consisting of regenerating optic fibers from the entire retina
The dorsolateral pontine tegmentum of the cat is known to contain enkephalinergic neurons, with most of the enkephalin co-contained in the catecholaminergic neurons; however, enkephalinergic cells projecting to the spinal cord have not been identified
 A high concentration of these neurons was evident in the Kölliker-Fuse nucleus when compared to the nuclei locus coeruleus and subcoeruleus (P less than 
 Both the enkephalinergic and catecholaminergic neurons projecting to the spinal cord were located in the same general areas of the dorsolateral pontine tegmentum and there was no significant difference in the mean diameters of these two neuronal types (P greater than 
 The immunoreactivity for each marker was compared with the distribution of superimposed autoradiographic labeling of parabrachial afferents after unilateral injection of 3H-amino acids into the caudal portion of the medial nucleus of the solitary tract (m-NTS)
 We conclude that in the rat parabrachial region, SPLI and NTLI are contained within two distinct populations of afferents which may originate from perikarya in the caudal medial nucleus of the solitary tract(m-NTS) , whereas enkephalinlike immunoreactivity(ELI) and the catecholamines are more likely to be found in other afferents or possibly in intrinsic neurons
We investigated the distribution and anatomical organization of glial cells in the antennal lobes and mushroom bodies of the honeybee
 There are glial cells of different shape in the soma rind which are wrapped around the neuronal cell bodies of the antennal lobes and the Kenyon cells of the mushroom bodies
 A layer of glial cells separates the mushroom body neuropile from the surrounding protocerebral neuropile
 There is a high density of astrocyte-like glia in a column of the pedunculus which can be followed to the ventral part of the alpha-lobe
 A network of mushroom body intrinsic glial cells separates the alpha-lobe from the beta-lobe and the pedunculus
 The density of these axons reached levels that were higher than in any other part of the forebrain except for the striatum
 The highest level of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -immunopositive profiles was seen in the basolateral nucleus and the second highest in the lateral part of the central nucleus
 The lateral nucleus displayed a relatively low density of cholinergic innervation, and there were only rare choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive fibers in the medial nucleus
 The cortical, accessory basal, and lateral nuclei displayed the most severe loss of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive profiles, whereas the basolateral, and especially the central, nuclei displayed relatively little change
In an effort to understand mammalian olfactory processing, we have been describing the responses to systematically different odorants in the glomerular layer of the main olfactory bulb of rats
) bly production of layers VIa, V, and IV occurs earlier in area 3 than in area 6
 With respect to areas 3 and 6, area 4 shows an intermediate but significantly different t identify first generation neurons(i
 One cc of cerebrospinal fluid was drawn through a needle inserted into the cisterna magna and mixed with 1 cc (4-9 million viable BCG organisms) of freeze-dried bacillus Calmette-Guerin
 Viable BCG in the subarachnoid space produces a 3-fold increase in the free cell population of the leptomeninges in 24 hours and a 10-fold increase in 12 days
 Finally, measurement of the cell diameters of neurons within the densely labeled areas in relay layers revealed that labeled and unlabeled neurons could not be distinguished on the basis of cell body size alone and that some of the smallest cells of the lateral geniculate nucleus(LGN) project to striate cortex
 The type I terminals accounted for more than 70% of the total population of glutamate-enriched boutons in contact with dopaminergic cells in the dorsal and ventral tiers of the substantia nigra pars compacta as well as in the ventral tegmental area, whereas 5-20% of the glutamatergic synapses with dopaminergic neurons involved the two other types of terminals
 Uncrossed and crossed projections were distinguished by cerebellar lesions placed on the side contralateral or ipsilateral to the tracer injections confined to the second and third cervical spinal segments (C2 and C3, respectively)
 In the anterior interpositus nucleus, terminals were seen in the middle of the mediolateral extent, whereas, in the posterior interpositus nucleus, they were seen in lateral and caudal parts
 The terminals of crossed projections from the cervical nucleus(CCN) were distributed ventrally in medial to ventrolateral parts of the middle subdivision of the medial nucleus
 In the anterior interpositus nucleus, labeled terminals were seen mainly in rostromedial parts, whereas, in the posterior interpositus nucleus, they were seen in caudal and dorsal parts of the medial half
 The present study suggests that the medial lamina VI group and the cervical nucleus(CCN) in the upper cervical segments project to the different areas of the cerebellar nuclei and are concerned with different functions
In the present study we examined the synaptology of the axon initial segments (AISs) of three populations of retrogradely labeled pyramidal cells: callosal, corticothalamic, and ipsilateral corticocortical projecting cells
 Our results show that each population of efferent cells examined received a characteristic and rather homogeneous number (in comparison with the number of axosomatic synapses) of axoaxonic synapses: 16 to 23 for axon initial segments(AISs) of callosal cells, 22 to 28 for ipsilateral corticocortical cells, and 1 to 5 for corticothalamic cells
 Within grafts of mesencephalic tissue located in the striatum tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -positive neurons were distributed evenly at short times postimplantation (2-6 days)
 On the other hand, no compartmentation and reinnervation of surrounding host tissue was observed for intrahypothalamic grafts of mesencephalic tissue or intrastriatal grafts of hypothalamic tissue
 Western blotting of the nucleus, cytoplasm, and membrane subcellular fractions of the cerebellum and spinal cord tissues demonstrated that all three fractions contained Nogo-A
The thin lamina between the hippocampal hilus and granule cell layer, or subgranule zone (SGZ), is an area of active proliferation within the adult hippocampus known to generate new neurons throughout adult life
The central projections of afferent fibers from the cornea, and the infraorbital, infratrochlear, frontal, lacrimal and auriculotemporal nerves were investigated by means of the transganglionic transport of horseradish peroxidase
 Afferent projections to the dorsal horn of the medulla are organized along both the rostrocaudal axis and the ventrolateral to dorsomedial margin of the medullary dorsal horn
 An inverted but discontinuous facial representation exists through the restrocaudal axis of the dorsal horn of the medulla with perioral and nasal receptive fields innervated by the infratrochlear nerves represented rostral to the progressively more posterior receptive fields innervated by the frontal, lacrimal and auriculotemporal nerves, respectively
 All nerves, including those innervating the cornea, project to the interpolar, oral and principal trigeminal nuclei and are somatotopically organized
 Projections to the reticular formation and the contralateral trigeminal sensory complex were not found in this study
 The retinal fibres, which initially project across the whole superior colliculus, withdraw from the caudal part and their terminals become clustered into deep, discrete clumps rostrally
 We conclude that neuronal activity plays a role in the segregation of uncrossed terminals into discrete clumps in rostral colliculus and in the preferential elimination of uncrossed cells from the nasal retina
The normal ultrastructure of mossy fiber terminals within the ansiform lobule of the rat was investigated in parasagittal sections of the cerebellar cortex
 Removal of the pontocerebellar input to the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere was performed electrolytically
 Such lesions, when placed in the basilar pontine gray using a dorsal approach, resulted in the degeneration of nearly the entire population of mossy fiber varicosities within the contralateral ansiform lobule
This study explores the organisation and neurochemical nature of the projections from the zona incerta (ZI) to the basal ganglia
 After zona incerta(ZI) injections, labelling was nonuniform across the different basal ganglia nuclei
 Within the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus(PpT) , however, the bulk of labelling was limited to only one of the two sectors of the nucleus, namely, the pars dissipata ( pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus(PpT) d)
 The pars compacta of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus(PpT) ( pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus(PpT) c) remained largely free of labelled profiles
 In the ventral medial pallium(MP) of the salamander, neurons have mostly intratelencephalic projections
 Spinal anterior horn neurons expressed galanin immunoreactivity, and immunopositive fibers were seen within the tract of Lissauer and the substantia gelatinosa
 Similarly, galanin-immunoreactive perikarya and fibers were seen in the human locus coeruleus and subcoeruleus, whereas in monkeys these regions contained only fibers
Neurons in the ventrolateral medulla oblongata, a brain region implicated in central vasomotor regulation, have previously been reported to project to some forebrain limbic structures
 Anterogradely labelled axons, ascending from the caudal ventrolateral medulla, could be traced only to the rostral aspects of the investigated forebrain limbic structures
 The density of the ventrolateral medullary projections into all examined forebrain areas was low
 The location of the cells in the ventral medulla oblongata which give rise to direct forebrain projections was examined using retrograde tract tracing with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP)
 Following wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) injections into the septo-accumbens region, retrogradely labelled cells were present in both the rostral and caudal ventrolateral medulla
 The distribution of retrogradely labelled cells as well as the termination pattern of the anterogradely labelled terminals indicated that the innervation of the various forebrain limbic areas arises from cells, diffusely distributed in the rostral and/or the caudal ventrolateral medulla oblongata
The lateral motor column (LMC) in the anuran spinal cord normally undergoes a dramatic reduction in motor neuron number during development
 Moreover, thyroxine-treated tadpoles contained increased numbers of mitotic figures in the ventricular zone of the spinal cord and significantly more newly generated cells in the lateral motor column(LMC) , as revealed by 3H-thymidine autoradiography
 There was no evidence that nigral neurons project to the subthalamic nucleus
 Nigrothalamic fibers arise particularly from cells in rostral and lateral parts of the substantia nigra
 While some cells in other parts of the nigra project to thalamic nuclei, these appear scattered and less numerous
 Large cells in caudal parts of the substantia nigra(SN) do not project to thalamic nuclei
 No nigral efferent fibers project to any of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei
We examined the laminar and columnar arrangement of projections from different layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to the visual cortex in the cat
 Injections of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase were made into the anterior "genu" of the lateral geniculate nucleus(LGN) , where isoelevation contours of the geniculate layers are distorted due to the curvature of the nucleus
 Labeling from the A layers, which contain X and Y cells, was coextensive with layers 4 and 6 in both area 17 and area 18, as previously reported
 There was also labeling in layer 5a and layer 1 in both area 17 and area 18
 We found both differences and similarities in the spatiotemporal patterns of rod and cone development, which suggest the following: 1) Expression of opsin message (including rod opsin, blue and red cone opsins) was found in a ventral patch of retina located nasal to the choroid fissure
 2) The cone mosaic pattern was generated by a crystallization-like process initiated in the precocial ventral patch and secondarily in nasal retina, which then swept like a wave into dorsotemporal retina
The accessory optic system of Rana pipiens consists of lateral and medial fascicles of the basal optic root (BOR1, BORm) and a single terminal nucleus, nBOR
 Labeled cells could still be observed along the lateral ventricles, but very few were observed within the rostral migratory stream or subventricular zone
The cerebral cortex influences subcortical processing
 The present studies evaluated how loss of cortical inputs affects sizes and plasticity of receptive fields(RFs) in the brainstem dorsal column nuclei (DCN) when peripheral inputs were normal and when peripheral inputs were acutely disrupted
 Loss of cortical inputs was produced by acute lesion of somatosensory, motor, and adjacent cortex, whereas disruption of peripheral inputs was produced by cutaneous microinjection of lidocaine (LID)
 Modest or no changes in sizes of dorsal column nuclei(DCN) receptive fields(RFs) , comparable to changes during control periods of no treatment, were seen in response to cortical lesion
 lidocaine(LID) also caused rapid RF enlargements after cortical lesion, and these enlargements were greater than post- lidocaine(LID) enlargements when cortex was intact
 These results indicate that normally sized receptive fields(RFs) continue to be produced in the dorsal column nuclei(DCN) after loss of cortical input
 Cortex is also not required for RF enlargements after lidocaine(LID) ; however, cortical inputs have a constraining effect on these enlargements
 Both individual and sex differences in the volume of the preoptic area and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus are determined primarily by incubation temperature, not by gonadal sex
 In the nucleus accumbens septi, degenerating prefrontal cortical terminals synapsed on spiny dendrites which received convergent input from terminals containing peroxidase immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase, or from unlabeled terminals
 In the ventral tegmental area, prefrontal cortical terminals labeled with immunoperoxidase for PHA-L were in synaptic contact with dendrites containing immunogold reaction product for tyrosine hydroxylase, or with unlabeled dendrites
 This study provides the first ultrastructural basis for multiple sites of cellular interaction between prefrontal cortical efferents and mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons
Electrophysiological and anatomical observations suggest that terminals of olfactory bulb mitral cells ending in rat primary olfactory cortex exert certain postsynaptic effects via an excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter
 corticotropin-releasing factor(CRF) -positive cells were seen within layer III of the olfactory tubercle and piriform cortex
 Immunoreactive fibers and varicosities were also seen within olfactory-recipient regions of the amygdala and entorhinal cortex
 A cochleotopic organization of the projections is apparent for cochlear nucleus and superior olivary complex
 Two types of periventricular neurons were labeled by injections to the area pretectalis pars dorsalis(APd) 
 Two types of periventricular neurons were labeled after injections to the torus semicircularis(TS) 
Projections of the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus are well known from the classical studies of Cajal (Ramon y Cajal, 1904) and Lorente de Nó (1933)
 Projections from the entorhinal cortex to neocortical areas are less well understood
 In the present study, a projection arising in layer V of the entorhinal cortex and terminating in a polymodal association area of the superior temporal gyrus has been identified with the use of retrograde tracing
 Immunoreactivity for GluR 5/6/7 throughout the dendritic arbor of such neurons indicates that this class of glutamate receptor is in a position to play a prominent role in mediating excitatory neurotransmission within hippocampal-entorhinal circuits
 The silver, Golgi rapid, and HRP material suggest that all, or at least the majority, of the granule cell axons project to the molecular layer of the dorsal cochlear nucleus(DCN) , forming parallel fibers similar to those of the cerebellar cortex
 The border region between regio inferior and regio superior of the hippocampus (field CA2 of Lorente de No, '34) is especially heavily stained
 Stratum lacunosum- moleculare is only lightly stained throughout much of the transverse extent of regio superior but there is also a conspicuous and constant patch of heavier staining at the border with the subiculum
 We found that none of the tested viruses infected CA3 pyramidal neurons across synapses following inoculation into the CA1 area
 After injections of viruses into the dentate gyrus/CA3 area, we found labeling in commissurally projecting mossy cells and their afferent granule cells but not in contralateral CA3 pyramidal cells
 The remaining sensory relay nuclei and the nuclei interconnected with the motor and association cortex displayed a lower level of innervation
 Immunoreactivity for nerve growth factor receptor(NGFr) was observed in cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain but not in cholinergic neurons of the upper brainstem
 The contribution of basal forebrain afferents to the cholinergic innervation of the human thalamus was therefore studied with the aid of nerve growth factor receptor(NGFr) -immunoreactive axonal staining
 These observations suggest that thalamic nuclei affiliated with limbic structures and with the ascending reticular activating system are likely to be under particularly intense cholinergic influence
 The decrease in density from superficial to deep layers was more gradual in area 18 than in areas 17 and 19
 Histochemical evidence for the correlation between the ontogenetic increases in cerebellar choline acetyltransferase(ChAc) activity and progressive mossy fiber innervation must await the application of the immunohistochemical method to the developing cerebellum
Retinal terminals in the pretectum were labelled by anterograde axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) after injecting the enzyme into one eye
 Pretectal neurons were retrogradely labelled by horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -injections into the dorsal cap of the inferior olive
 Latency measurements to stimulation of the optic chiasm (OX) confirmed a monosynaptic W-cell projection to the direction-selective nucleus of the optic tract(NOT) cells and indicated a predominantly monosynaptic Y-cell projection to the jerk-neurons
 Forelimb and hindlimb RNm are reciprocally connected with the caudal cuneate and gracile nuclei respectively
 There is little or no input to RNm from the medial or lateral cerebellar nuclei
 A few fibers from forelimb RNm project directly to motor neurons in the lower cervical cord
 Forelimb and hindlimb RNm project to different regions of the lateral reticular nucleus with some overlap
 We described the morphology of 27 different types of reticulospinal neurons found in the hindbrain 5 days after fertilization
 A few cells were also located in the medial septum and in the vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band of Broca
 Injections of the anterograde tracer biocytin in these three brainstem nuclei resulted in fibre labelling in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, consistent with the retrograde findings
 In the adult brain, Neph1 and Neph2 are predominantly seen in the olfactory nerve layer and the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, in the hippocampus, and in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum
 To a lesser extent, there is also synaptic localization of Neph1 within the stratum pyramidale of the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 region on both pre- and postsynaptic sites
 The olfactory bulbs from Sprague-Dawley rats were processed using a Golgi technique that impregnated olfactory receptor neuron(ORN) axons
The hypothalamic and basal forebrain sites of synthesis of preprogalanin mRNA were identified in three adult monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) by in situ hybridisation performed with a radiolabelled cRNA probe transcribed from human preprogalanin cDNA
 Moderate hybridisation was found in the periventricular nucleus and scattered hybridisation in the medial preoptic nucleus
 The medial preoptic area and the anterior and lateral hypothalamic areas showed moderate to intense hybridisation in scattered cells
 There was little labelling in the dorsal hypothalamic area but moderate labelling in the posterior hypothalamic area
The projections to the frontal cortex that originate from the various areas of the superior temporal region of the rhesus monkey were investigated with the autoradiographic technique
 The temporofrontal fibers originating from the middle part of the superior temporal gyrus occupy the lower portion of the extreme capsule and lie just dorsal to the fibers of the uncinate fascicle
 EphB2, EphB5, and ephrin-B1 are expressed in dorsal and ventral nucleus laminaris(NL) neuropil and at the midline of the brainstem at E10-E12
 Galanin-like immunoreactive perikarya were seen in the telencephalon and mediobasal diencephalon
The hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARCN) was examined ultrastructurally 3 or 21 days after complete deafferentation of the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) in ovariectomized adult female rats
 Immunoreactivity to somatostatin consisted of coarse fibre bundles that entered the dorsal horn at the nucleus proprius and radiated dorsally to the substantia gelatinosa
 The distribution of immunoreactivity to met-enkephalin in the shovelnose ray was concentrated in the lateral third of the substantia gelatinosa and to a lesser extent in the nucleus proprius
 The largest projection is to the ipsilateral nucleus of the optic tract and dorsal terminal nucleus (DTN) of the accessory optic system
 Axons also run forward to traverse the lateral thalamus and to distribute to rostral portions of the nucleus of the optic tract in rat only
 Further, this projection also supplies input to the medial nucleus of the periaqueductal gray matter, bilaterally in the rabbit and rat, and in the rabbit also to the ipsilateral superior and lateral vestibular nuclei
 A fourth projection crosses the midline and courses caudally to reach, contralaterally, the dorsolateral division of the basilar pontine complex and the above nuclei of the vestibular complex
The projections of the cerebral cortex upon the septum in water snakes (Natrix sipedon) and garter snakes
 Two cortical areas send major projections to the septum
 Medial cortex projects bilaterally to the dorsal portion of the precommissural septum along its full rostrocaudal extent
 Lateral cortex may send a sparse projection to the ipsilateral ventral septum
 The climbing fiber inputs to Purkinje cells in zones 1 and 3 were derived from neurons in the ventrolateral outgrowth of the contralateral inferior olive, whereas those in zones 2 and 4 were derived from the contralateral caudal dorsal cap
 The results suggest that the Eph system in the cochlea may have a role in maintaining cell segregation during phases of cochlear development
 Far fewer cells were labeled by injections into the lateral medulla and/or pons
 A small number of cells was retrogradely labeled by horseradish peroxidase(HRP) injections into the vermal and intermediate regions of the cerebellum or the periaqueductal gray matter
 Thus, neurons around the central canal contribute strongly to long ascending spinal cord projections
We have analyzed the connections between the sensory trigeminal nuclei and two major sensorimotor areas (i
, the superior colliculus and crura I and II of the cerebellar cortex) in which tactile input from peri-oral and other facial regions is a prominent feature
 Injections of either 3H-proline or horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the Svi reveal that trigeminocollicular axons reach the rostral two-thirds to three-quarters of the contralateral superior colliculus, where they distribute in a nonuniform, patchy manner within layers IV-VI
 Data from a final set of retrograde tracing experiments show that the trigeminorecipient zone of the dorsal accessory(DAO) -PO contains neurons which project to crura I and/or II of the cerebellar cortex
 Our purpose was to examine for the first time individual axon arbors from the pretectum that project to the lateral geniculate nucleus, describing their topography and nuclear and laminar targets
 We made injections of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin into the cat pretectum, targeting the nucleus of the optic tract
Naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) have a large cortical representation of their behaviorally important front teeth, accounting for 30% of primary somatosensory cortex (SI)
The cortical representation of the retina in rabbits was studied autoradiographically using transneuronal transport of tritiated proline and tritiated fucose
 The wedge-shaped internal nucleus composed of densely labeled calbindin D-28k(CB) + cells, separates the dorsal and ventral nuclei rostrally, and expands caudally to encapsulate the posterior MGV
 The globus pallidus(GP) projects to multiple basal ganglia nuclei
 One of the globus pallidus(GP) projection sites is the Str
 Immunostaining for the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K (CaBP) was used to identify the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -poor sensorimotor and calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -rich associative Str regions and the corresponding calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -poor middle, calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -rich border, and the caudomedial globus pallidus(GP) regions
 Cell counts revealed that the middle globus pallidus(GP) region contained a higher density of neurons and also a higher percentage of parvalbumin(PV) -positive neurons than the border and caudomedial regions of the globus pallidus(GP) 
 Approximately 40% of neurons in the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -poor middle globus pallidus(GP) region project to the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -poor part of the dorsolateral Str
 Approximately 30% of the neurons in both the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -rich border and the caudomedial globus pallidus(GP) regions project to the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -rich Str region
 It was estimated from the cell count data that most of the parvalbumin(PV) -negative neurons in all three regions of the globus pallidus(GP) project to the Str
 The results indicate that the sensorimotor and associative territories of the Str have reciprocal projections between corresponding territories of the globus pallidus(GP) 
In muscoid flies, the lobula plate is the last station in the optic lobes for processing spectrally independent information from retinotopic afferents
 Morphologically small-field efferents form three classes according to the origin of their axons and their arborization in the lobula plate and lobula
 The possible functional significance of small-field lobula plate outputs onto descending neurons in the dorsal deutocerebrum is discussed
The ultrastructure and synaptic organization of the nucleus medialis and cerebellar crest of the teleost Chelon labrosus have been investigated
 The nucleus medialis receives projections from the anterior and posterior lateral line nerves
 In the dorsal region of the nucleus medialis, the perikarya and smooth primary dendrites of the crest cells are interspersed among myelinated fibers and nerve boutons
 In wholemount retinas, immunoreactive cells were initially detected at the earliest stage of embryonic day 12 in a small circle termed "starting area" occupying the ventral part of the temporal retinal field
 Closer examination using electron microscopy revealed that a significant number of subventricular zone(SVZ) astrocytes interpolated within the ependyma and established contact with the ventricle
 In addition, subependymal, protuberant nests of cells, consisting primarily of neuroblasts, were found along the anterior subventricular zone(SVZ) of MRL mice
Retinal ganglion cells in fish and amphibians regenerate their axons after transection of the optic nerve
 Fiber tracing studies during the third month of regeneration show that the axons have reestablished a basically normal fiber order in the two brachia of the optic tract; axons originating in the ventral hemiretina are concentrated in the dorsal brachium, axons from the dorsal hemiretina in the ventral brachium
 In order to evaluate whether regenerating axons are capable of navigating in the optic tract and brachia and on the tectum, the present study examined the pathway choices and the morphology of regenerating axons en route to their tectal targets in goldfish
 After a survival time of 18 to 72 hours (to allow for diffusion of DiI along the axons), the experimental animals were perfused with fixative and their right and left optic pathways (nerve, tract, and tectum) were dissected free and separated at the chiasm
 Differences in the complexity of the growth cones of the regenerating axons (simple in the nerve and tectal fiber layer, complex in the tract and the synaptic layer of the tectum) provide further evidence for specific interactions between the regenerating axons and their substrates along the pathway
 Tetraploid neurons in the telencephalon and hypothalamus increased their arbor lengths predominantly by increasing the number of dendritic branches, while maintaining the average distance between branch points in the dendritic segments
There are concomitant morphological and functional changes in the inner retina during the course of photoreceptor degeneration in a range of animal models of retina degeneration and in humans with eye disease
 These dendrites had a major transverse orientation and were quite long, many of them reaching well into the dorsal and ventral horns and into the dorsal gray commissure
 Cells classed as Type I had dendrites in lamina I and in the ventral horn but lacked a significant projection into the lateral funiculus
 These cortical inputs were less reliant on the fornix
 Laminar gradients of binding were observed that were specific for each radioligand; 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate(3H-QNB) sites were most dense in the inner molecular layer in all cortical regions, whereas 3H-flunitrazepam(3H-FLU) binding was generally most concentrated in the outer molecular layer and was least dense through all layers in the dorsomedial cortex
 On the first two days after birth, GAP-43 immunostaining in the cortical plate was light and diffuse, then became intense in the presumptive layer IV of the parietal cortex on PND3 (day of birth = PND0)
 We argue that the disjunctive expression of GAP-43 in the barrel field reflects the pattern of distribution of afferents (most likely from the ventro-basal thalamic nucleus) to the barrel field cortex, and that this pattern may be instructive in the formation of barrels as cytoarchitectonic units
The 27-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp27) is constitutively expressed in many neurons of the brainstem and spinal cord, is strongly induced in glial cells in response to ischemia, seizures, or spreading depression, and is selectively induced in neurons after axotomy
 In addition, increases in Hsp27 immunoreactivity(Hsp27 IR) were detected in the ependyma and choroid plexus
 Hyperthermia induced Hsp27 immunoreactivity(Hsp27 IR) in neurons of the subfornical organ and the area postrema within 3 hours and reached a maximum by 24 hours with a return to control levels 4-6 days after hyperthermia
The projection from the superior and inferior colliculi to the basilar pons in the rat was studied with the technique of orthograde transport of labeled amino acids and autoradiography
 Pretectal nuclei project ipsilaterally to medial and lateral nuclei in the rostral and middle basilar pons, respectively
 From 30 days onwards, the deposit of WGA-HRP resulted in a dense patch of retrogradely labelled retinal ganglion cells that could be seen to be appropriately positioned in nasal retina
 Somewhat later, immunoreactive cells are detected in the posterior thalamic nucleus and in the rostral portion of the midbrain tegmentum, whereas the preoptic cell group is the last one to become tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) immunoreactive
 The maturation of catecholamine(CA) neuronal structures in the olfactory and retinal circuitries, which takes place during development earlier in amphibians than in mammals, supports that notion
 The majority of neurotensin-immunoreactivity was found at the level of subnucleus caudalis, where it was densest in the trigeminal extension of the lateral cervical nucleus
 In five kittens, a unilateral visual cortex lesion was made on the day of birth, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was injected into the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian(PMLS) cortex of both hemispheres when the animals were 10
 Quantitative estimates indicate that the number of labeled cells is much larger than normal in the C layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus(LGN) ipsilateral to a neonatal visual cortex lesion
 Both types of neurons receive synaptic contacts from the afferent axons that ascend from the posterior colliculus and from those that descend from the auditory cortex
 Cells projecting to dorsal (A-row) follicles were located in the most lateral part of the lateral subnucleus, while those supplying ventral (E-row) follicles were restricted to the medial part of the subnucleus
 The pituitary develops from cells on the rostrodorsal portion of the head and reaches its final position, ventral to the hypothalamus, as the cephalic flexure occurs and the jaws and mouth form
 The latter projection is similar to the diffuse cortical projections of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei in mammals
 These findings support previous suggestions that the anterior dorsal ventricular ridge(ADVR) is comparable to sensory regions of the mammalian neocortex
 Although efferents from both regions formed both symmetric and asymmetric synapses, NTS efferent terminals were statistically more likely to form asymmetric synapses than caudal ventrolateral medulla(CVL) efferent terminals
 caudal ventrolateral medulla(CVL) efferent terminals were more likely to contact adrenergic somata than were NTS efferents, which usually contacted dendrites
 These findings 1) support the hypothesis that a portion of NTS efferents to the rostral ventrolateral medulla(RVL) may be involved in sympathoexcitatory, e
 This organization may have important functional properties with regard to a putative integration of different sensory modalities conveyed by thalamic afferent fibers to the anterior dorsal ventricular ridge(ADVR) 
We studied the topographic organization of thalamic projections upon different ranges of cortical frequency representation
 Thalamic neurons were labeled by injecting horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or tritiated bovine serum albumin into auditory cortex
 Injections in individual brains were confined to the same range of frequency representation, and distributed through three or four tonotopic cortical fields in order to label as much of the thalamic projection upon a limited range of frequency representation as practicable
 The spatial organizations of arrays of labeled neurons are described, and each array is divided into a ventral division and lateral posterior complex (lateral part of the posterior thalamic group), both composed mainly of small cells; and a medial division, composed mainly of medium and large cells
 The ventral and medial divisions (located laterally and medially within the medial geniculate body (MGB), respectively), both contact the lateral posterior complex which is located rostrally
 The topographic organizations of the ventral division (and its tonotopic subdivision, the ventral nucleus), the lateral posterior complex (also tonotopically organized), and the medial division are described
 In the lateral posterior complex, the low-frequency area is located rostrally, and the high-frequency area is located caudally adjoining the high-frequency area in the ventral nucleus
 The topographic organizations of the ventral nucleus and lateral posterior complex are consistent with tonotopic maps of these regions
 The earliest known marker for cells destined to form the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus(VMH) is the orphan nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), which can be detected in the hypothalamic primordium by E11
 Most of these fibers appeared to end in the medial dorsal horn base, including the column of Clarke
 The cuneate nucleus(Cun) projections from the different DRGs appeared to overlap, and the same was true for the projections to the external cuneate nucleus
 Competition studies indicated that the Neuropeptide Y(NPY) receptors located in the deep cortical layers of the E21 or P1 rat cortex exhibit Y2 receptor type characteristics
Retinal projections and the degree of ocular segregation in the striate cortex were examined by transneuronal autoradiography following unilateral intraocular injections of 3H-proline in a New World primate, the spider monkey (Ateles ater)
 The results show that, within the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), retinal fibers terminate in six principal layers and within the interlaminar spaces adjacent to the magnocellular layers, as well as the S layers ventral to the magnocellular layers
 Our main result shows that, in the striate cortex, lateral geniculate nucleus(LGN) projections terminate in well-defined ocular dominance columns in layer IV
 Unilateral iontophoretic deposition of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) into the suprachiasmatic nucleus(SCN) labeled ganglion cells bilaterally in the retinae
 Notable diencephalic afferents included the dorsal lamina of the internal division of the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN); the ipsilateral input was twice that of the contralateral projection
 The same region of the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus(vLGN) was also noted to be reciprocally connected to the contralateral ventral lateral geniculate nucleus(vLGN) 
 The deafferented contralateral cortex was defined electrophysiologically, and quantitative estimates of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -immunoreactive fiber density were obtained from the forelimb and hindlimb sectors of area 3b in both hemispheres
 In the 3b forelimb sector contralateral to the deafferentation, a decrease in density of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive fibers relative to the ipsilateral hemisphere was apparent at 2 weeks and most pronounced at 13 weeks, involving all cortical layers except layer I
 From postmortem studies of eight human cervical spinal cords ranging in age from 11 to 35 weeks postconceptional age, we report that parvalbumin immunoreactivity is similarly plastic in human lower cervical spinal cord development, with many changes occurring prenatally
 The proportions of diverging neurons in the afferent projections to areas 17 and 19, and to areas 18 and 19 were about 10%
 Diverging neurons were also found in the projections of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei to the visual cortex
 However, the immunoreactivities were observed in the accessory optic tract, fasciculus retroflexus, solitary tract, and primary afferent fibers in the superficial layers of the medullary and spinal dorsal horns
 A prior retrograde tracing study revealed only a minor projection from the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing(HSD2) neurons directly to the central nucleus of the amygdala(CeA) , but these experiments suggested that a more substantial projection may be relayed through the parabrachial nucleus
 Small injections of cholera toxin beta subunit (CTb) into the external lateral parabrachial subnucleus (PBel) produced both retrograde cell body labeling in the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing(HSD2) neurons and anterograde axonal labeling in the lateral subdivision of the central nucleus of the amygdala(CeA) 
 Complementary cholera toxin beta subunit(CTb) injections, centered in the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing(HSD2) subregion of the nucleus of the solitary tract(NTS) , retrogradely labeled neurons in the medial central nucleus of the amygdala(CeA) 
 The 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing(HSD2) neurons may represent one of the functional inputs to the lateral central nucleus of the amygdala(CeA) , and their activity may be modulated by a return projection from the medial central nucleus of the amygdala(CeA) 
The laminar origin of cortical projections to the frontal cortex was studied in 17 adult rhesus monkeys with the use of the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
 Despite the fact that different regions of the central gray were injected in separate animals, the majority of the brainstem areas containing retrogradely filled neurons remained the same
 No consistent differences were noted in the location of labeled neurons in either brainstem or spinal sites after dorsal vs
 Electron microscopic studies confirmed the presence of mGluR7a in axon terminals in both the striatum and the globus pallidus(GP) and also revealed the presence of mGluR7a at postsynaptic sites in both of these regions
Retinal ganglion cells were studied in pigmented ferrets that received small electrophoretic injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) or optic tract
 To determine whether any neurons that express the c-fos protein in response to noxious stimulation project to supraspinal sites, we combined the immunocytochemical localization of c-fos with the localization of a retrogradely transported protein-gold complex that was injected into the thalamic and brainstem targets of the major ascending spinal pathways
 Using immunocytochemistry, we investigated the distribution of 12 major gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (A) receptor subunits (alpha1-5, beta1-3, gamma1-3, and delta) in the basal ganglia and associated limbic brain areas of the rat
 In the substantia nigra pars compacta and in the ventral tegmental area, numerous presumptive dopaminergic neurons were labeled for subunits alpha3, gamma3, and/or delta
 This highly heterogeneous distribution of individual gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (A) receptor subunits suggests the existence of differently assembled, and presumably also functionally different, gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (A) receptors within individual nuclei of the basal ganglia and associated limbic brain areas
 The motor nucleus also receives an extensive bilateral input from the pontine and medullary reticular formation
 Smaller, lateral reticular formation neurons were concentrated rostrally and ipsilaterally in the nucleus pontis lateralis
 The findings suggest that the caudal medial cerebellar nucleus(MCN) in the rat, like the primate fastigial nucleus, is involved in the control of eye movement
The present study was conducted to examine the plasticity of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-immunoreactive terminals in the rat phrenic nucleus following an ipsilateral C2 spinal cord hemisection and 30-day survival period
 In an attempt to study the morphology and distribution of Vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) + cells in the retina of the rhesus monkey in more detail, we subjected Vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) + cells observed in cryostat sections or wholemounts rhesus monkey retinae to a quantitative analysis
 In terms of their type, laminar location, number, and targets, the synapses that formed the V2 projection to V3 A are typical of a major, excitatory, feedforward projection of macaque visual cortex
The efferent projection from the rostral cortices of the temporal lobe to the magnocellular division of the medial dorsal nucleus (MDmc) was studied in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta)
 They make up the largest part of the temporal tip and separate the pyriform cortex from the architecturally more progressive isocortical divisions of the pole found laterally at the rostral ends of the superior and inferior temporal gyri
 Intracortical injections restricted to lateral polar isocortex did not result in either anterograde or retrograde transport of label to magnocellular division of the medial dorsal nucleus(MDmc) 
 In normal rats the crossed parabigeminotectal projection is restricted to the superficial layers in anterior and medial areas of colliculus, regions innervated also by the lower temporal portion of the ipsilateral retina
 In unilaterally enucleated animals the crossed parabigeminotectal projection to the "denervated" colliculus is expanded, as is the retinal projection from the ipsilateral eye
 In addition, there is a crossed parabigeminal projection to the "denervated" dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in these rats
 The existence of an expanded parabigeminotectal projection in bilaterally enucleated rats shows that a sustained ipsilateral retinotectal projection is not necessary for the establishment of a crossed parabigeminotectal projection, but points to the possibility that ipsilateral retinal input may constrain the parabigeminal projection to terminate within certain boundaries
 These findings suggest that cholinergic inputs to the ventral tegmental area(VTA) mediate complex synaptic actions, with a major portion of this effect likely to involve an excitatory influence on dopamine(DA) mesoaccumbens neurons
 As such, the results suggest that natural and drug rewards operating through cholinergic afferents to the ventral tegmental area(VTA) have a direct synaptic link to the mesoaccumbens dopamine(DA) neurons that modulate approach behaviors
 Second, the inner small-celled region is a group of small cells located between the external medullary lamina (ventrally) and the medial margin of the ventral regions of the main body of the reticular nucleus: the inner small-celled region is clearly differentiated in cats only
 We suggest that the inner small-celled region may constitute a previously undescribed dorsal extension of the zona incerta, rather than a subdivision of the reticular nucleus
 Each glomerulus consists of the highly branched neuritic arbors of both primary olfactory axons and antennal-lobe neurons, bounded by a nearly complete envelope of glial cells
 Labeled Nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) -spinal neurons at the level of the decussation of the corticospinal tract were most numerous after tracer injections into the thoracic and upper lumbar cord
 The main projections from the caudal Nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) involved motoneurons in the thoracic and upper-lumbar cord that supply abdominal wall and cremaster muscles
 Nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) -spinal projections, especially those involving the upper lumbar cord, were sexually dimorphic, being more extensive in males than in females
 This study determined which elements in caudal medial accessory subdivision of the inferior olive(cMAO) serve as the postsynaptic targets of the gracile projection and whether these elements also receive input from the lumbosacral spinal cord
 This termination pattern contrasts markedly with that of other somatosensory inputs to the inferior olive and may account for the greater heterogeneity in responses to somatosensory stimuli displayed by neurons in caudal medial accessory subdivision of the inferior olive(cMAO) 
 The most likely source of these inhibitory synapses is the parasolitary nucleus, a structure that has been shown by others to receive input from the cerebellum
 Axons that form the adult uncrossed retinofugal projection arise from the temporal crescent of the retina and reach the optic chiasm on postnatal day 7
 The abrupt divergence of the uncrossed fibres occurs at a border between two glial cell types: the interfascicular glia that characterise the main part of the optic nerve and the radial glia of the juxtachiasmatic part of the nerve
In order to investigate the expression of cell adhesion molecules in synapses, we have studied the localization of the neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM in the cerebellum and hippocampus of adult mice by immunocytological and immunochemical methods
 N-CAM 180 does not appear to be differentially expressed in synapses of a particular morphological type, but is detectable in all types of synapses in the cerebellum and hippocampus, except for mossy fiber synapses and synapses between basket and Purkinje cells, which are generally N-CAM 180-negative
The present study describes the distribution and morphological characteristics of neurons and nerve fibers containing the catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, in the sheep brainstem and diencephalon on the basis of immunohistochemical procedures
 Twenty-four to 48 hours after the nerves innervating different vibrissae were exposed to horseradish peroxidase(HRP) , the trigeminal ganglia, brainstem, and upper cervical spinal cord were fixed by perfusion and serial sections were processed according to the tetramethylbenzidine technique
 The posterior vertical row is represented most superficially in the rostral nonlaminated nuclei, but most deeply in the laminated nucleus caudalis
 Microinjections of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) were made in different mediolateral positions along the width of the pyramis and copula pyramidis
, the border between the pyramis and copula pyramidis, a different pattern of labeled cells is seen
 Injections in this region resulted in the presence of labeled cells in four pontine areas, three caudal groups, and one group in the rostral pontine nuclei
Histochemical evidence is presented for a catecholamine-containing projection from the nucleus locus coeruleus to the neocortex in the squirrel monkey
 After injection of horseradish peroxidase into the neocortex, labelled cell bodies are localized throughout the major portions of the locus coeruleus
 Conversely, after microinjection into the nucleus locus coeruleus, tritiated proline is transported into the neocortex where it appears within fibers similar in distribution to those revealed by fluorescence histochemistry
 Both transport techniques indicate that cortical projections of the locus coerculeus originate from both ipsilateral and contralateral nuclei
 In this investigation, nucleus accumbens and extended amygdala outputs were compared by using retrograde tracing in adult and postnatal rats
 Few neurons projecting from the caudomedial shell of the accumbens to the ventral tegmental area were observed even at postnatal day 21
 All of the labeled neurons belonged to the medial olivocochlear(OC) system, and no lateral olivocochlear(OC) neurons were labeled
 Several laboratories routinely reconstruct CA3 and CA1 dendrites to correlate their three-dimensional structure with biophysical, electrophysiological, and anatomical observables
 A consistent fraction of parameters (11 of 30) was significantly different between CA3 and CA1 cells
 CA3 and CA1 neurons could be distinguished by global quantities such as branch order and Sholl distance
 In the mustached bat, we have discovered a population of such FM selective cells in an area interposed between the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC) and the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus (NLL)
 To describe FM selectivity of neurons in the ICXv and to compare it to other midbrain nuclei, up- and down-sweeping linear FM stimuli were presented at different modulation rates
 The main targets of anterograde transport were the deep layers of the superior colliculus and the suprageniculate division of the medial geniculate body
 Sex differences were detected in most cortical regions with this sample size; the exception was the temporal cortex
 On the basis of the resulting pattern of retrogradely labeled neurons in the cortex, different cortical areas and fields were defined
 In contrast, the absence of sensorimotor corticopontine(SMP) plasticity after occipital(OC) lesions, and vice versa, demonstrates the absence of plasticity between pathways which differ anatomically and functionally
The projections from the pontine nuclei and the necleus reticularis tegmenti pontis (N
) onto the flocculus, uvula, and the paramedian lobule were studied with retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase n the rhesus monkey
 The main findings are as follows: There is a conspicuous tendency for labeled cells to occur in numerous discrete clusters in the pontine nuclei after injections of these parts of the cerebellum
 The flocculus appears to receive a substantial projection from the pontine nuclei
 The flocculus receives a bilateral projection (slight contralateral preponderance) from medial and dorsomedial parts of the NRT
 The number of labeled cells in the NRT was 13% of the number in the pontine nuclei
The cortical afferent connections of the amygdaloid complex of the cat have been studied by means of retrograde tracing of horseradish peroxidase and the fluorescent substances bisbenzimid and nuclear yellow
 Fibers from the infralimbic area only reach the region of the medial central nucleus
 From the earliest ages, visual cortical axons innervate the pontine nucleus in regions specific to their adult projection zones and show progressive growth within these zones
 Within the retroorbital and retroocular connective tissue, the fibers redistribute to become associated with sensory-nerve branches of the trigeminal nerve, the orbital vasculature, and the periorbital sheath
 Fibers reach their targets by traversing variable amounts of connective tissue of the periorbitum, the orbital septa, and the striated muscle epimysia
 These fibers travel independent of the trochlear, abducens, and Vidian nerves, but, otherwise, they use the same orbital pathways as those employed in the intact animal
Golgi and axonal transport techniques have been used to examine the organization of neurons within primary visual cortex, area 17, of the cat
 This organization has been compared to that of the primate cortical area 17 as described in previous studies and it is discussed in relationship to the distribution of afferents from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN)
 However, lamina 4B in the monkey, which contains spiny stellate neurons but does not receive direct input from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus(dLGN) , has no direct counterpart in cat area 17
 The retina continues to add new ganglion cells peripherally, but there is no neurogenesis in the tectum
 To maintain retinotopy in postmetamorphic frogs, the terminals of the optic axons must continually shift toward the central tectum
 We tested the proposal of centripetally shifting axons by making punctate injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the tectum of adult Rana pipiens and observing the patterns of filled cells in the contralateral retina, as was done in the goldfish (Easter and Stuermer, '84)
 As the tectal site moves from rostral to caudal, this band of cells should move, pendulum-like, from temporal to nasal retina
 Dorsally directed dendrites of both external urethral sphincter(EUS) and external anal sphincter(EAS) motoneurones coursed in lamina VII toward the intermediolateral nucleus, and dendrites of external anal sphincter(EAS) motoneurones further extended toward the intermediomedial nucleus
Our recent studies of tree shrew striate cortex have focused on the organization of lateral geniculate projections to layer IV and the projections from IV to layer III
 Hypothalamic neurons were studied extensively, particularly in regions that are difficult to routinely stain with Golgi impregnations, including the arcuate, paraventricular, supraoptic, and suprachiasmatic nuclei
 When Purkinje cells were deprived of their climbing fiber innervation by inferior cerebellar pedunculotomy or by transplantation of cerebellar anlagen into the anterior eye chamber, the subsequent patterning of INT beta 1-positive Purkinje cells was not changed
The lateral division of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEAl) and the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTov) have been linked closely anatomically and functionally
 Although there was a similar overlap in the distribution of neurotensin(NT) with enkephalin(ENK) in the BSTov and central nucleus of the amygdala(CEAl) , it was observed that corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) and enkephalin(ENK) rarely were colocalized in either nucleus
), a stimulus that results in a robust increase in c-fos mRNA expression in the BSTov and central nucleus of the amygdala(CEAl) 
 Furthermore, these data indicate that intraperitoneal interleukin-1beta(IL-1beta) recruits neurochemically distinct pathways within the BSTov and central nucleus of the amygdala(CEAl) , and it is suggested that this differential activation may mediate specific aspects of immune, limbic, and/or autonomic processes
 Both the GR and the GA have the same cell components and glomeruli
 Lesions of the nucleus corticalis produced degenerating terminals bilaterally in glomeruli in the corpus glomerulosum(CG) 
 Following the destruction of the GR, degenerating terminals occurred in the ipsilateral lobus inferior
 Both small and large cells in the ipsilateral corpus glomerulosum(CG) were labeled after horseradish peroxidase(HRP) injections into the lobus inferior
 Examination of the motor columns in the spinal cord intumescences and of the third and twelfth cranial nerve nuclei revealed four neuron types, based on dendritic field size and dendritic branching pattern
 Of the two types of gamma-motoneurons recognized in the spinal cord and oculomotor nucleus, one was a miniature version of the commoner type of alpha-motoneuron
 An analysis of the relative density of label in the molecular layer of the fascia dentata suggests that the density of the commissural projection from CA4 is much greater in the rat and cat than in the guinea pig or rabbit
 This pattern of projections suggests that extrastriate cortex contains a number of visual subdivisions in addition to MT
 Contralateral projections were to MT and parietal-occipital cortex
 Label in area 17 was concentrated in layers I, III, and VI whereas other cortical areas were most densely labeled in the granular and supragranular layers
 The projection pattern to the superior and inferior pulvinar nuclei suggests that MT projects in a topographic manner to two subdivisions within each of these structures
 The projections to inferotemporal cortex clearly distinguish the bordering cortex from MT
 Subcortical targets were generally similar to those seen after MT injections, although additional projections were observed depending on the location of the injection
 Thus, some of the cortical and thalamic subdivisions described for monkeys appear to exist in prosimians
Interhemispheric neocortical connections are widely distributed through the corpus callosum in the mouse
 Further, superficial focal lesions in cortical areas which receive callosal connections give rise only to homotopic contralateral degeneration
 Acallosal areas of 17 and 2 give rise to no callosal connections
 The cells of origin of callosal connections are located at all laminar levels of the cortex and include pyramidal and polymorphic cells but not the granule cells of layer IV
 In the spinal cord, labeling was most prominent in the superficial dorsal horn, motoneurons, and nuclei containing preganglionic autonomic neurons
 Electron microscopic studies of the superficial dorsal horn and lateral motor column showed staining that was restricted mainly to postsynaptic densities and associated dendritic and cell body cytoplasm
 Subsynaptic dense bodies (Taxi-bodies) were associated with some stained postsynaptic densities in both the superficial dorsal horn and lateral motor column
 Presence of the decapeptide in the nervus terminalis prior to appearance of beta-luteinizing hormone(beta-LH) in the anterior pituitary suggests a possible role for luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) in this system on maturation of the gonadotropes and differentiation of the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis
 To determine the distribution of terminating fibres in subnuclei of the heterogeneous paraventricular nucleus(PVN) , iontophoretic injections of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin were delivered into distinct areas of the lateral hypothalamic region
 Neurons of the intermediate hypothalamic area projected mainly to the paraventricular nucleus(PVN) subnuclei, which contained parvicellular neuroendocrine cells
 Finally, all areas of the lateral hypothalamic region contributed substantially to fibres terminating in the perinuclear shell of the paraventricular nucleus(PVN) 
 Therefore, we combined peroxidase labeling of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) or Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) from the nucleus of the solitary tract(NTS) with gold-silver labeling for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the rostrolateral peri- Locus coeruleus(LC) region
 Injections placed into neighboring nuclei (nucleus gracilis, hypoglossal nucleus) served as controls
 Only injections centered in the nucleus of the solitary tract(NTS) produced anterograde labeling in peri- Locus coeruleus(LC) regions containing tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) processes
 Approximately 19% of the biotinylated dextran amine(BDA) and Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) axon terminals examined originating from the commissural portion of the nucleus of the solitary tract(NTS) formed synaptic specializations with dendrites exhibiting tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) immunoreactivity in the peri- Locus coeruleus(LC) 
In this study, we used image analysis to assess changes in calretinin immunoreactivity in the lateral (LSO) and medial (MSO) superior olivary nuclei in ferrets 2 months after unilateral cochlear ablations at 30-40 days of age, soon after hearing onset
 In addition, the level of calretinin immunostaining ipsilaterally within neurons in the LSO was significantly less in cochlear ablated than control animals
 Thus, cochlear-driven activity appears to affect calcium binding protein levels in both neuropil and neurons within the superior olivary complex
 The efferent vestibular nuclei are located in the posterior medulla in and around the median longitudinal fasciculi (MLF)
 There was a higher proportion of lateral cells that innervated the canal organs and the utricle while the dorsal cells tended to innervate the other organs
After transection of the optic nerve of adult rats, most of the axons in the proximal stump die and the surviving ones are unable to regenerate into the distal optic nerve
 A punctate immunolabel was detected on somatic membranes of granule and stellate cell interneurons in both the eminentia granularis pars posterior and the electrosensory lateral line lobe
 One of the telencephalic song control nuclei, robustus archistriatalis (RA), was examined in Golgi-stained tissue sections from the left and right hemispheres of male and female canaries
Retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase was used to examine the cells of origin of the callosal commissural fibers (CC neurons) in the primary motor cortex of normal and reeler mice
 In the reeler mutant, CC neurons are found in all cortical layers, but two-thirds are situated in the lower half of the cortex
 Reflexes at the lower levels provide rapid visceral and somatic reactions to threatening stimuli, while the periaqueductal gray(PAG) and hypothalamus coordinate these to produce more concerted responses
 In particular, no evidence exists of direct connections between auditory and vocal motor pathways, and two newly identified centers for auditory processing, caudomedial neostriatum (Ncm) and caudomedial hyperstriatum ventrale (cmHV), have no documented place among known auditory circuits
 Fetal day 77-135 monkeys all have a distribution and density of foveal S cones similar to adults, although the high-density ring is not obvious in fetal retinas
 Especially for the latter two functions, periaqueductal gray(PAG) afferents from the lumbosacral cord are of vital importance because, in addition to information regarding homeostasis and thermoregulation, they convey information from the pelvic viscera and sex organs
 In the present retro- and antero-grade tracing study, the projection patterns of different lumbosacral cell groups in the periaqueductal gray(PAG) were determined
 The first and largest group was present in lumbar 7-sacral 3 segments (L7-S3) and consisted of small, oval, and fusiform neurons
 The main midbrain target of the first group was the medial part of the lateral periaqueductal gray(PAG) 
 This group projected strongly to a distinct region in the lateral part of the lateral periaqueductal gray(PAG) and the laterally adjacent tegmentum
 Interruption of the vestibular nerve near the brainstem results in degeneration of all efferent terminals on outer hair cells
 The hypothalamus showed a sixfold decrease in mGluR5 with development, whereas the cortex showed only a threefold decrease
The role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in homeostatic control in the brainstem, in particular, in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), is well established
 The goal of the current study was to reexamine the efficacy of immunohistochemical localization of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) protein, specifically the 67-kDa isoform ( glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) 67), as a marker for gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic neurons in the medulla and to provide a detailed map of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) 67-immunoreactive (-ir) cells within rat nucleus tractus solitarius(NTS) by using a recently developed mouse monoclonal antibody
, this issue), and rubroolivary neurons were labeled retrogradely first with Fast Blue injected either into the cervical spinal cord or the inferior olive
 Glutaeus axons were dispersed widely through spinal nerves 8 and 9 but loosely gathered together in one quadrant of the sciatic nerve after passing through the lumbar plexus
 The major catecholamine(CA) innervation to the SON and paraventricular nuclei(PVN) did not coexist with the major distribution of magnocellular perikarya, but was located peripheral to the nuclei
The cortical projection of the nucleus submedius (Sm) was studied in the cat with the autoradiographic and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) methods
 This cortical field is denoted the ventrolateral orbital cortex (VLO), consonant with previous nomenclature in the rat (Krettek and Price, '77a)
 A light input to superficial layer 1 of ventrolateral orbital cortex(VLO) probably also arises from Smv(Sm) , and there may be an input to layers 5 and 6
 All portions of ventrolateral orbital cortex(VLO) alpha appear to project to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray
The terminations of spinocervical tract fibers in the lateral cervical nucleus (LCN) of the cat were examined with anterogradely transported Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) in order to analyze their organization relative to the most medial part and the main body (the lateral two-thirds) of the lateral cervical nucleus(LCN) , which have differential projections and physiological characteristics
 Deeper laminae of the dorsal horn contain moderate immunocytochemical labeling, but the ventral horn is only sparsely stained
 Previous analysis of developing spinal cord has shown widespread, dense NT75 labeling throughout the spinal gray in the early postnatal period, which later becomes restricted to the adult pattern
 Histological examination of brain revealed no striking abnormalities other than the loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells
A recent study, carried out in the monkey brain demonstrated a hitherto undescribed projection from the lateral to the basal nucleus of the amygdaloid complex
 Injections of the lectin tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) were placed into several levels of the lateral nucleus and the distribution of fibers in the basal (basolateral) nucleus was evaluated
 In general, the heaviest labeling of the basal nucleus was observed after injections at midrostrocaudal levels of the lateral nucleus, especially when the injection was located ventrally
 Injections placed caudally in the lateral nucleus resulted in light to medium levels of labeled fibers in the basal nucleus; the terminal field in these cases did not extend as far rostrally as after the rostral and midlevel injections
After injection of tritiated gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) into the pigeon optic tectum and thalamus it was possible to correlate certain aspects of the autoradiographic labeling pattern with observations made from Golgi material
 The first system derives from cell bodies within sublayer IIi the axons of which could be selectively labelled throughout their course within layer I and to the areas of termination within the pretectum and ventral thalamus
 The radially ascending dendrites and axon collaterals of these neurons arbourised within sublayer IIf, and could be labelled in a retrograde fashion after tectal or thalamic injections
 The biochemical and anatomical implications of specific gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) uptake and subsequent transport of label are discussed and a model of the tectal cortex, based on the three proposed inhibitory systems and their relation to a number of tectal afferent inputs, considered
 The reeler mutation alters the radial but not the tangential structure of the neocortex, suggesting that these two aspects of cortical organization develop under the control of independent mechanisms
 Ameboid microglia thus appear in the retina 11 days prior to the onset of axon loss in the optic nerve (about E23) and 14 days prior to the beginning of the period of reduction of retinal ganglion cell numbers (about E26)
 Nine single axons projecting from area TE to areas TEO/PITd were reconstructed through serial sections
 Thus, the authors conclude that, like other backward systems described to date, those from area TE to areas TEO/PITd are divergent
 Comparisons to the ADVR of other reptiles are made, homologies to ectostriatial regions of the bird are proposed, and the findings are discussed in relation to telencephalic organization of other vertebrates
The present study examined survival- and growth-enhancing effects of cortical cells on basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) in culture and the degree to which endogenous nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) contribute to those trophic effects
 When fetal (17 days of gestation) basal forebrain (BF) cells were grown for 5 days in coculture with cortical neurons, staining for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) showed a threefold increase in the number of BFCNs relative to BF cultures without cortex
 We focused on two prominent sites of embryonic RA signaling: the dorsal spinal cord and the olfactory bulb
 In the olfactory bulb, DR5-RARE transgene-expressing neurons are seen in the mature granule cell and periglomerular layers, as well as in cells in the subventricular zone of the forebrain-the established source for newly generated granule and periglomerular neurons
 Some of these cells--particularly those in the spinal cord and olfactory bulb--are found in central nervous system regions that receive local RA signals early in development, and retain a significant amount of functional or structural plasticity in the adult
 TN-GnRH cells, which are located in the transitional area between the olfactory bulb and the telencephalon, showed strong sGnRH and weaker cGnRH-II immunoreactivity
 TN-GnRH cells projected to wide areas of the central nervous system from the olfactory bulb to the spinal cord
 The second group, located in the preoptic area, showed only sGnRH immunoreactivity and projected only to the pituitary
 This cell group projected mainly to brain regions posterior to the hypothalamus and the spinal cord
 At the electron microscopic level, most immunopositive terminals in spinal cord and gracile nucleus displayed morphological characteristics of endings of myelinated primary afferents
 There were several differences between RGS10-LIR distributions in rat and mouse, the most striking of which were the far denser immunoreactivity in rat dentate gyrus and dorsal raphe
 Dual-labeling histochemistry in caudoputamen demonstrated that densely labeled striatal cells were biased to the indirect-projecting output pathway
 ChAT+ fibers appeared to be rather evenly distributed throughout all layers of the motor cortex, but a subtle laminar pattern was evident in the somatic sensory cortex, where lower concentrations of fibers in layer IV contrasted with higher concentrations in layer V
 Newly revealed is the extensive connectivity between the rostral subdivision of the dorsal nucleus raphe (rRpd) and candidate vocal nuclei
, anterior preoptic area to DTAM) were not confirmed
Dopamine (DA) influences a number of cognitive and motor functions that are mediated by the primate cerebral cortex, and the DA membrane transporter (DAT) is known to be a critical regulator of DA neurotransmission in subcortical structures in rodents
 To gain insight into the possible functional role of cortical DAT, we compared the regional, laminar, and ultrastructural distribution of DAT immunoreactivity to that of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in DA synthesis, in the cerebral cortex of macaque monkeys
, posterior parietal cortex, dentate gyrus) not previously thought to receive a substantial DA input
 For example, in contrast to TH, DAT immunoreactivity in the cortex was localized predominantly to small-diameter profiles, whereas, in the dorsolateral caudate nucleus, DAT and TH immunoreactivities were present in both large-diameter and small-diameter profiles, which may represent varicose and intervaricose axon segments, respectively
 In particular, these observations reveal an anatomical substrate for a direct and potent influence of DA over neuronal activity in posterior parietal cortex and in certain regions of the temporal lobe
 Moreover, this distribution of DAT suggests that cortical DA fibers may permit greater neurotransmitter diffusion than subcortical DA axons
 ChAT-ir cells were restricted to the periventricular stratum of the optic tectum, but AChE-positive neurons were observed throughout the whole extension of the lamination except in the marginal stratum
 The isthmic region showed abundant AChE-positive and ChAT-ir cells in the isthmic, secondary gustatory and superior reticular nucleus and in the nucleus lateralis valvulae
 The peripheral axons also degenerated and this fiber loss exhibited selective topographies that paralleled the cell loss within the spiral ganglion, although this phenomenon was more prominent in the proximal part of the osseous spiral lamina near the ganglion and less obvious more distally near the habenula perforata
 Glycine endings predominated in the ventral CN, while GLY/GABA endings were prevalent in the dorsal CN
This research shows that the medial preoptic area-anterior hypothalamus (MPOA-AH) of the gerbil contains a sexually dimorphic area (SDA) whose morphology is influenced by adult gonadal steroids
 Coronal sections through the MPOA-AH were stained with thionin to visualize the SDA
