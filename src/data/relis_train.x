Connections of the BR1 with BR2 in the rat.

The present study was undertaken to establish the precise anatomical relationship of the BR1  with BR2 in the rat.

The results of these tracing experiments confirm the general notion of reciprocal connections between the BR1 and BR2.

The reciprocal projection from this BR1 to BR2 appears to be very sparse.

The BR1 sends a very sparse projection back to the BR2 .

The projections of the BR1 to the BR2 appear also to be topographically organized.

In addition, a number of BR1 fibers reach the midbrain BR2.

These findings suggest a role for the BR1 in nonmotor functions of the BR2.

Serotoninergic and noradrenergic projections to the BR1 of the monkey BR2.

The midbrain BR1 was the major site of origin for neurons providing a serotoninergic projection to the BR2.

The areal and laminar distributions of the projection from the BR1  were studied in BR2 of the cat with the anterograde tracing method by using wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase.

In BR1 and BR2, the projection fibers terminate in the superficial half of layer I and in the full portions of layers III and IV, forming double bands.

The present results demonstrate that the BR1 fibers terminate in a localized fashion in both the BR2 and that these W-cell projections are quite unique in their areal and laminar organization compared with the X- and Y-cell systems.

Synaptology of the direct projections from the BR1 to BR2 of the rat.

During the pharyngeal phase of the swallowing reflex, the BR1  receives peripheral inputs from the pharynx by means of the BR2 and is the location of premotor neurons for the pharyngeal  motoneurons.

We investigated whether the neurons in the BR1 projected directly to the pharyngeal motoneurons or to the other kinds of neurons in the BR2 by using the electron microscope.

Observations of serial ultrathin sections revealed that both the small and the medium-sized neurons received only a few labeled axosomatic terminals that were exclusively Gray's type I. These results indicate that the BR1 neurons may send mainly inhibitory as well as a few excitatory inputs  directly to the BR2 .

The region of the BR1 is a major target of dehydration-sensitive CRH neurons in the rat BR2.

Although labelled fibers from these injections were seen throughout the brain, the region of the BR1 and BR2  were most conspicuous in also having corticotropin-releasing hormone immunoreactive fibers.

These results strongly suggest that the BR1 activated by cellular dehydration provide an input to the region of the BR2.

Striatal and central extended BR1 parts of the BR2: evidence from tract-tracing techniques in the rat.

The BR1  lies at the junction of the striatopallidal system and the BR2 (i.e.

Our anterograde tracing experiments reveal that the projections of the BR1 largely reciprocate its afferent connections  and are very similar to those of the BR2.

Local connections are found within BR1 and within BR2, but the two divisions are not interconnected.

Efferent BR1 projections of the BR2 in the rhesus monkey.

In the BR1, labeling was found in the BR2.

BR1 inputs define a caudal component of the BR2 in primates.

The BR1 mediates goal-directed behavior through BR2 afferents.

However, BR1 also receive inputs from the BR2.

There are also BR1 inputs to calcium binding protein -positive areas outside the shell, which originate mainly in the BR2.

Role of the BR1 in the control of blood pressure: descending pathways to BR2.

Electron microscopic studies using combined anterograde tracing and pre- and post-embedding immunogold labelling have shown that the pathways originating from the BR1 to the BR2 are inhibitory and may use GABA as a neurotransmitter.

The results of these studies suggest that blood pressure changes produced by activation of the BR1 may be mediated by attenuation of baroreceptor reflexes through a GABAergic mechanism at the level of the BR2.

The BR1 , homolog of the primate BR2, modulates circadian rhythms.

Here, BR1 -efferent pathways are identified with the anterograde tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin, with projections to over 50 BR2.

The BR1 also receives projections from the BR2 and may contribute to both sleep/arousal and visuomotor function.

The mammalian BR1  receives input from all BR2 and provides extensive projections to the central nervous system.

BR1 in the rat: projections to BR2.

This paper describes the quantitative areal and laminar distribution of identified neuron populations projecting from areas of BR1  to BR2 in the rat.

High-resolution flat-map density distributions of retrogradely labelled neurons indicated that specific BR1 regions were differentially involved in the projections studied, with BR2 divided into dorsal and ventral sectors.

Comparable data for the BR1 show that this nucleus plays critical roles in the pupillary light reflex, light-evoked blinks, rapid eye movement sleep triggering, and modulating BR2 involved in circadian rhythms.

Our investigation shows that the primate BR1 receives both direct and indirect projections from BR2.

They divide as they enter the BR1, the so-called BR2.

The indirect corticostriatal projection derives from a thin collateral emitted within the BR1 by thick, long-range fibers that descend toward the BR2.

The collateral enters the BR1 dorsomedially and remains unbranched until it reaches the BR2, where it breaks out into two to four axonal branches displaying small and equally spaced varicosities.

Both direct and indirect corticostriatal axons branch moderately but occupy vast BR1, where they appear to contact en passant several widely distributed BR2 neurons.

The 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 neurons do not innervate the BR1, a key BR2 autonomic site.

Ultrastructural organization of BR1 inputs to the BR2.

Consistent with this, there are direct BR1 projections to the BR2 .

However, the significance of the latter projection remains unclear because no data are available regarding the BR1 targets of BR2 axons.

In these two BR1, BR2 axon terminals only formed asymmetric synapses, typically with gamma-aminobutyric acid -immunonegative spines  but occasionally with dendritic profiles , half of which were gamma-aminobutyric acid immunopositive.

In the light of earlier observations, these findings indicate that BR1 inputs exert mainly excitatory effects in the BR2, prevalently on principal neurons.

The stimulation sites (BR1 [L-STG] and BR2 [L-IPL]), modality of targets , and task  were manipulated independently.

The observed double dissociation suggests that the conscious task instruction modulates the stimulus-driven activation of the BR1 for lexico-phonological activation and the BR2 for spoken word production, and thereby engages a different neural network for generating the appropriate behavioral response.

Top-down control of BR1 ensembles by BR2.

BR1 might alter neuronal activity in areas such as BR2 to inhibit temporally inappropriate responses.

We then reversibly inactivated BR1 while recording ensemble activity in BR2.

Inactivation of BR1 reduced delay-related firing, but not response-related firing, in BR2.

These data suggest that functional interactions between BR1 and BR2 might serve as a top-down control signal that inhibits inappropriate responding.

Patterns of cortical label were related to myeloarchitecture in sections cut parallel to the surface of flattened BR1, and to BR2 processed for cytochrome oxidase .

BR1 revealed a caudorostral series of myelin dense ovals  in BR2 that represent the periodontal receptors of the contralateral teeth, the contralateral tongue, the ipsilateral teeth, and the ipsilateral tongue.

Multisensory convergence in BR1, I. Cortical connections of the cBR2 in macaque monkeys.

The BR1  has anatomical and physiological features consistent with its role as a first-stage  BR2.

A companion paper describes the BR1 connections of BR2 (Hackett et al., J. Comp.

As expected, connections with adjacent BR1 were stronger than connections with BR2.

Taken together, the findings indicate that BR1 may receive somatosensory input from nearby areas along the BR2.

BR1 stimulation and neuronal activity in the BR2 in Parkinson's disease.

During stimulation of the subthalamic(BR1) stimulation at 14-Hz, no change in either the mean firing rate or the discharge pattern of BR2 neurons was observed.

stimulation of the subthalamic(BR1) stimulation at 140-Hz decreased the mean firing rate by 64% and the mean duration of bursting mode activity of BR2 neurons by 70%.

The BR1 residual neuronal activity during 140-Hz stimulation of the subthalamic(BR2) stimulation was driven by the stimulation of the subthalamic stimulation.

How the decrease in rate and modification of firing pattern with evoked neuronal activity of BR1 neurons during high frequency stimulation of the subthalamic(BR2) stimulation contribute to the improvement of Parkinsonian motor disability remains to be elucidated.

Neuronal degeneration and reorganization: a mutual principle in pathological and in healthy interactions of BR1 and BR2.

Based on developmental principles and insights from animal research about neuroplasticity in cell assemblies, this article is to propose a view of plasticity that promotes a link between BR1 and BR2 structure and function.

Both the mitotic activity  in BR1 and the maturation of dopamine fibres  in the BR2 proved to be a measurable combination for investigating the complex chain of events that relate activity dependent neuroplasticity to normal as well as to pathological maturational processes.

In the BR1, where ontogenetic plasticity proved to be preserved by continued neuro- and synaptogenesis, serious damage can be internalized without simultaneous disruption of neural dynamics offering an approach to reverse dysfunctional reorganization in the BR2.

BR1 projections from the whisker-sensitive regions of the BR2 in the rat.

This study investigated the axonal projections of whisker-sensitive cells of the BR1 (BR2) in rat oral, interpolar, and caudal divisions .

In this study, BR1 and BR2 efferent projections were compared by using anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin and retrograde transport of FluoroGold.

Topographic organization of BR1 inputs to the lateral nucleus of the macaque monkey BR2: a retrograde tracing study.

In the BR1, retrogradely labeled cells were most numerous in the rostral  portion of the BR2.

Although retrograde tracers can provide only limited evidence for topography, we nonetheless noted that the density of retrogradely labeled cells in a BR1 reliably depended on the location of the tracer injection in the BR2.

Topographic projection from the BR1 to the BR2 of the barn owl.

Injections of biotinylated dextran amine and Fluoro-Gold in the BR1 retrogradely labelled neurons in layers 8-15 of the BR2  that could carry this instructive signal.

This projection was point-to-point and in register with the feed-forward, auditory projection from the BR1 to the BR2 .

Biocytin injected into the superficial layers of the BR1 labelled bouton-laden axons in the BR2.

These axons were generally finer than, but had similar bouton densities as, feed-forward auditory fibers in the BR1, labelled by injections of biocytin into the BR2 .

Subcortical projections of BR1 (BR2) of the macaque monkey.

In several species, including primates, stimulation studies indicate that the BR1, the most caudal part of the BR2, functions as a visceral motor region.

To determine the BR1 projections of this region in primates, injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinin, biotinylated dextran amine, or rhodamine-labeled dextran amine were placed in BR2 in three monkeys.

BR1 terminal fields of individual axons from the BR2 in Macaca mulatta.

This study examined organization of the projection from the BR1 to the BR2 in Macaca mulatta.

The distribution of all contralateral terminal fields in the BR1 was charted, and representative individual axons that terminated in the BR2 were traced in serial sections under the light microscope.

The results reveal a complex organization of the input from the BR1 to the BR2 that only partially fits into the traditional concept of somatotopic organization of the nucleus.

BR1 projections to the BR2 in the hamster.

Specific anatomical subdivisions of the BR1 receive taste afferent input and contain interneurons and projection neurons that engage ascending or BR2 taste pathways.

cholera toxin B was injected into the BR1 to label, by retrograde transport, the sources of BR2 inputs.

Intramedullary cholera toxin B labeling after BR1 injection indicates that the rostral central subdivision also receives projections from the BR2 .

BR1 projections to distinct longitudinal columns of the BR2 in the rat.

We utilised retrograde and anterograde tracing procedures to study the origin and termination of BR1  projections to the BR2  in the rat.

A previous study, in the primate, had demonstrated that distinct subgroups of BR1 areas project to specific BR2 columns.

Anterograde tracing experiments revealed that the projections to different BR1 columns arose from specific BR2 areas.

As well, consistent with the retrograde data, projections arising from select BR1 terminated selectively in the BR2 .

We show that the nucleus receives inputs from several widely distributed areas in the BR1 and, to a much lesser extent, from the BR2 as well.

Overall, the present analysis helps to delineate BR1 circuits seemingly critical for the organization of innate fear responses to environmental threats, where the BR2 presents a major associative role.

Furthermore, by means of massive inputs from the BR1, the BR2 is in a position to integrate information from a neural system involved in spatial working memory, which may be of particular relevance for an effect of attentional mechanisms on the selection of appropriate escape strategies.

Only BR1 projected to the BR2, and this projection as small.

Connections between the BR1 and the BR2 in the Japanese monkey .

The connections between the BR1 and BR2 were examined in the Japanese monkey  by means of retrograde and anterograde tract-tracing methods with wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase  and fluorescent dyes .

Each of these BR1 was reciprocally connected with the entire rostrocaudal extent of BR2.

In the BR1, labeled cells were located in BR2 (i.

near the BR1), but not in BR2 (i.e.

The BR1 in direct reciprocal connection with BR2 were presumed to be involved in the memory system, especially in the system for declarative memory.

BR1 connected with the BR2 in a Madagascan hedgehog tenrec.

The most prominent input to the BR1  originated from the BR2.

An exception was the BR1, which was poorly connected with the BR2 .

However, there was an BR1, which could be differentiated from the BR2 by its intense reaction to NADPh-diaphorase.

The variability of cell populations and BR1 connections shown here may help to clarify both phylogenetic relationships and the significance of individual basal BR2 subdivisions.

In one of these three monkeys, biotinylated dextran amine and cholera toxin subunit b were injected into the BR1 to retrogradely identify BR2 neurons.

The results show that a compact group of neurons in the BR1 at the intercollicular level sends a dense projection to the BR2 .

It is concluded that there exists a strong and direct BR1 - BR2 pathway in the rhesus monkey.

Neurotransmitters contained in the BR1 inputs to the monkey BR2.

Auditory information from the BR1 reaches the BR2  by way of two pathways: a direct thalamo-amygdala projection and a polysynaptic thalamo-cortico-amygdala projection.

Furthermore, the extent and topographical distribution of bifurcating cells that project to both BR1 and BR2 are also unknown.

There are no apparent differences in the size, shape, or density of terminal specializations in BR1 or BR2, and, consistently with previous double-labeling experiments , some axons can branch to both areas.

The retrospleniocollicular connection is of interest because it constitutes one link between the BR1, which is considered the anatomical substrate of emotional experience, and the BR2 , which mediates approach and avoidance behavior.

Terminal fields originating in BR1 were preferentially distributed in BR2, respectively, but there were also large, densely innervated regions in which the terminal fields overlapped.

Fluoro-Gold injections in the BR1 confirmed the retrospleniocollicular topography and demonstrated that this connection originated from layer V pyramidal cells of all BR2.

The present results demonstrate that the BR1 is the origin of a broad and dense network of axonal branches that may modulate BR2 -mediated motor and physiological responses involved in emotional behavior.

The results support the subdivision of the BR1 into "medial" and "orbital" networks and suggest that the prefrontostriatal projections reflect the functional organization of the BR2 rather than topographic location.

In part of a closer investigation of corticohippocampal systems, the authors applied single-axon analysis to the connections from the BR1  to the BR2.

For 4 axons, branches were followed to BR1 and to the border between the BR2, raising the suggestion that these areas, which sometimes are viewed as serial stages, are tightly interconnected.

BR1 connections in turtles with special reference to the BR2: a hodological and gamma-aminobutyric acid-immunohistochemical study.

Comparison of these findings with previous work on other species reveals striking similarities between the BR1 pathway in turtles and birds and in the BR2 pathway in turtles, birds, and mammals.

Corticostriatal projections from focal sites in both BR1 exhibited substantial amounts of divergence within the BR2.

We found that the proportion of overlapping projections to the BR1 was moderately correlated with the amount of overlap observed in the BR2.

Projections from the BR1 to BR2 in neonatally deafened cats.

In the present study, anatomical projections from the BR1  to BR2  were investigated in normal adult cats and in animals that were neonatally deafened with the ototoxic drug amikacin.

However, retrograde tracer injections into different regions of BR1 produced a normal pattern of labeling in the BR2 .

In both experimental and control animals, the main mass of labeled BR1 cells was found in the BR2 v.

Different isofrequency contours in BR1 receive input from different portions of the BR2 v.

The relatively normal thalamocortical projection pattern suggests that, after neonatal BR1 lesions, the major reorganization of cochleotopic maps occurs at BR2 levels.

Organization of projections from the BR1 to the BR2 in the rat.

The detailed organization of projections from the BR1 to the BR2 of the rat was studied by using anterograde tracing.

A mediolateral topography was noted in the projections from the BR1 to the BR2.

Projections from the BR1 to the BR2 were found to follow a basically rostrocaudal topography.

Its rostromedial parts are directed to the BR1 and its caudolateral part reach the BR2.

Study of projections from the BR1 to the BR2 of the rat.

This excitatory input is most likely derived from axons that branch as they pass through the BR1 to the BR2.

These structures are thought to play differential roles in higher-order discriminative and homeostatic ( BR1 ) versus BR2 .

After BR1 injections, approximately 18% of the Fos-like immunoreactive  neurons were double-labeled; after BR2 injections the proportion was 9%.

On the other hand, regardless of stimulus, twice as many Fos-like immunoreactive neurons projected to the BR1 as to the BR2  .

A plausible hypothesis for reconciling this apparent discrepancy is that many Fos-like immunoreactive neurons make local projections in BR1, that in turn give rise to BR2  connections.

Relationship between BR1 and BR2 neurons in lampreys.

Some afferents showed large, bulb-like enlargements  and about 20 of these were found in the BR1, whereas about 40 were found in the BR2.

In addition, BR1 with bulb-like enlargements in apparent contact with BR2 neurons were transneuronally labeled by biocytin.

This anatomical organization suggests that afferents carrying bulb-like enlargements convey dynamic information to BR1, which, in turn, project to the BR2 networks.

BR1 monosynaptically innervate extranuclear noradrenergic dendrites in the rat BR2.

Previous reports using light microscopy have provided anatomical evidence that neurons in the BR1  innervate the medial pericoerulear dendrites of noradrenergic neurons in the BR2 .

The present study used anterograde tracing and electron microscopic analysis to provide more definitive evidence that neurons in the BR1 form synapses with the somata or dendrites of noradrenergic BR2 neurons.

Ultrastructural analysis of anterogradely labeled terminals at the levels of the rostral  and caudal  subdivisions of the BR1 indicated that approximately 20% of these form synapses with tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive dendrites; most of these were located in the BR2.

These results provide direct evidence for monosynaptic projections from neurons in the BR1 to the extranuclear dendrites of noradrenergic BR2 neurons.

In contrast, injections centered in the neighboring BR1  revealed inputs mainly from BR2, consistent with previous studies.

Both BR1 and BR2 projections course in diffuse pathways.

Extensive overlap was observed between the targets of these BR1 fibers and those of the secondary efferent projections of the BR2, though the latter were more numerous and reached additional targets.

Tracer application to the BR1 also revealed a number of bulbopetal neurons in the BR2, as well as crossed interbulbar projections.

The presence in a chondrostean of important BR1 projections and their extensive overlap with BR2 projections suggest that such projections are a derived characteristic of bony fishes.

BR1 projections to midline and BR2 of the rat.

The projections from the BR1 to the BR2 were examined in the rat.

The BR1 received an input only from the BR2.

Finally, the waist area of the BR1 was densely labeled after cholera toxin-beta injections in the BR2.

In addition, the developmental changes observed involve both reductions in the total number of BR1 neurons and a differential loss of BR2 projections.

In series of experiments it was shown that the focus of exciting neurons, forming the descending singular-autonomic discharge is localized in the BR1 of BR2.

In another series of microelectrophysiological experiments it was shown downward blocking inhibitory influence of BR1 on activity of vagal viscerosensory neurons of BR2.

Within the BR1, 60% of the projecting activated cells were catecholaminergic, as were 59% of such cells in the BR2.

This suggests that oxytocin and vasopressin neurons within the BR1 are stimulated at parturition via afferent inputs from the BR2, but the input is not exclusively noradrenergic.

Afferents to the BR1 and functional subdivisions of the BR2: neuroanatomical substrates for affective behavior.

Our laboratory has shown that electrical stimulation of the BR1  versus the BR2 , in the rabbit, elicits two distinct behavioral/cardiorespiratory response patterns.

Separate retrograde tracers were injected into functional subdivisions of the BR1 and the BR2 in rabbits.

Relative distribution of synapses in the BR1 of the cat: implications regarding the "driver/modulator" theory of BR2 function.

To provide a quantitative comparison of the synaptic organization of "first-order" and "higher-order" BR1, we followed bias-corrected sampling methods identical to a previous study of the cat BR2 (dLGN; Van Horn et al. [2000] J. Comp.

However, in comparison to the BR1 , the BR2 receives significantly fewer numbers of RL, F1, and F2 contacts and significantly higher numbers of RS contacts.

Thus, the RS/RL synapse ratio in the BR1 is 24:1, in contrast to the 5:1 RS/RL synapse ratio in the BR2 .

BR1 is part of the electromotor corollary discharge pathway, and its projection to BR2 suggests a feedback loop.

Kitt and Brauth [1981] Neuroscience 6:1551-1566) and adjacent BR1 can be subdivided into several distinct subareas that are chemically comparable to mammalian BR2 structures.

The BR1  is theorized to be homologous to the BR2.

The function of the corticogeniculate feedback pathway from the BR1  to the BR2  in primates is not well understood.

Pressure injections of biotinylated dextran were made into owl monkey BR1, and the resulting labeled axons were reconstructed through serial sections of the BR2 .

Unlike corticogeniculate axons seen in the cat, corticogeniculate axons in the owl monkey maintained topographic innervation in the BR1 layers that was consistent with receptive field sizes represented in BR2.

The distribution of retrogradely labeled neurons showed no clear segregation along the BR1; they were usually located along the entire BR2.

For all BR1, there was a general trend of the labeled neurons to occupy the BR2 along the dorsoventral axis.

The same territories were labeled after injection in BR1, but in addition numerous labeled neurons were found in the most BR2.

At higher resolution, however, there was clear evidence that the territories projecting to BR1 and BR2 formed separate, interdigitating, clusters along the dorsoventral axis.

A comparable local segregation was observed for the two subdivisions of BR1, whereas there was more local overlap among the BR2 .

Axonal sprouting of a BR1-BR2 pathway after estrogen administration in the adult female rhesus monkey.

BR1 projections to the BR2 are species specific and might be involved in mating behavior.

In the female cat, this behavior is estrogen dependent, and estrogen induces axonal sprouting in the BR1 -BR2 pathway.

The effect of estrogen was studied on the BR1 -lBR2 projection with the use of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as a tracer in six adult ovariectomized rhesus monkeys with or without estrogen priming .

Light microscopy showed that the density of arborizing labeled BR1 axons in the BR2 was greater in estrogen-treated than in control animals.

The results showed that estrogen induces axonal sprouting in a BR1-BR2 pathway in the adult female rhesus monkey.

These findings supported the concept that the BR1 -BR2 pathway may be involved in sexual behavior.

Moreover, they demonstrated that a long descending BR1-BR2 tract in adult nonhuman primates retains the capacity for axonal sprouting.

Origin of the dopaminergic innervation of the BR1 and BR2 shell: a combined retrograde tracing and immunohistochemical study in the rat.

By using an anti-dopamine serum, BR1 projections to BR2 were confirmed to be in part dopaminergic.

A small number of cells sent collateral projections to the BR1 and BR2.

The double-labeled cells constituted fewer than 2% of the cells that projected to the BR1 or to the BR2.

The results indicate that the synaptic organization of Gamma-aminobutyric acid -positive profiles in the BR1 nucleus is very similar to that in other BR2.

Especially the dopaminergic cells, located in the BR1 ( BR2 c), are of great neurologic interest, because the functional deficit and depletion of these cells are the correlate of Parkinson's disease.

We used a combination of in situ hybridization histochemistry  and immunohistochemistry  on sections of human postmortem BR1 to investigate the expression of GABA receptor subunit messenger RNAs  and of the receptor protein in dopaminergic BR2 cells.

This might represent a negative feedback loop between the BR1 and the BR2 c and be a target of pharmacologic interventions in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

Relationships between the BR1 component of blinking and the BR2  were studied in rats.

To localize primary afferent eyelid projections in the BR1, neuronal tracing experiments were performed as well as analysis of c-Fos protein expression after BR2 stimulation.

The c-Fos immunoreactivity was observed in neurons located in the BR1  and BR2.

Injections in BR1 showed retrogradely labelled neurons predominantly within the BR2 .

This is the first study using anti-protein gene product 9.5  immunolabeling and confocal microscopy on thick sections to examine systematically the terminal arborizations of the various BR1 endings and to compare them between two species, the rat and the cat, that have similar-appearing BR2 but different exploratory behaviors, such as existence or absence of whisking.

Otherwise, the inner conical body of rat BR1 contains en passant, circumferentially oriented lanceolate endings that are lacking in the cat, whereas the BR2 of the cat has en passant corpuscular endings that are lacking in the rat.

The lateral edge of BR1 was marked by an abrupt change in the receptive fields : BR2, they were strictly unilateral and relatively small.

BR1 projections to BR2 of the rat.

The projections from the BR1 to the BR2 were examined in the rat.

The discussion focuses on BR1-BR2 pathways that are likely involved in arousal, somatosensory, and visceral functions.

Postnatal refinement of BR1 projections to the BR2 in cats.

In this study, we made restricted injections of Neurobiotin, which labeled small sectors  of the BR1, to study the projections of BR2 fibers representing a narrow band of frequencies.

Two injections spaced &gt; or = 2 mm apart in the BR1 resulted in labeled bands of projecting axons in the BR2 that were 53% broader than would be expected if they were proportional to those in adults, and the two projections were incompletely segregated in the youngest animals studied.

Projections to the BR1 were 32% broader in neonates than in adults when normalized, but the BR2 projections were always discrete, even at the earliest ages studied.

BR1 of the macaque monkey: projections to the BR2.

We investigated the topographic and laminar organization of the efferent BR1 projections of the BR2.

BR1 afferents from the BR2 in the macaque monkey.

Additional injections of retrograde tracers were made into the BR1 to define the origin of corticospinal projections from the BR2 .

BR1 was defined as that part of BR2 that is the source of corticospinal projections.

Considering the functional properties of the areas that form these circuits, it is proposed that the BR1 circuit is involved in controlling movements on the basis of somatosensory information, which is the traditional role proposed for the whole BR2.

BR1 territories innervated by BR2 afferents in the hedgehog tenrec, Echinops telfairi.

This insectivore shows one of the lowest size indices among mammals for both the BR1 and the BR2.

The most remarkable finding may be the tenrec's BR1 projection to the BR2.

The projection to the BR1  is located immediately rostral to the area receiving ascending somatosensory afferents and appears to originate, in particular, from the BR2.

A faint-to-moderate projection, on the other hand, has been traced consistently to the ventral portion of the BR1 and the adjacent BR2.

In addition, there are prominent cerebellosubthalamic projections to the BR1 and the BR2.

In this study, the authors analyzed the BR1 efferents to the BR2 by using the anterograde and retrograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine.

These bands of fascicles are divided along the midline in a "zone of reorganization" to create two full maps of the BR1 surface; however, this map is discontinuous in that BR2 are adjacent to one another.

In the BR1, axons undergo another reorganization such that BR2 axons shift position and become localized laterally and ventrally, whereas centrally placed axons become localized dorsally.

In the BR1, axons diverge to form three central, optic tracts: the medial optic tract, the projection to the BR2, and the basal optic root.

Anterograde labeling in the BR1 was strongest in the BR2.

Glutamate receptor subunits in the BR1 and other regions of the BR2 in the cat.

Following specific neonatal brain lesions in rodents and ferrets, BR1 axons have been induced to innervate the BR2 .

In a second group of experiments, newborn ferrets received different combinations of lesions of normal BR1 targets and BR2 afferents.

Indeed, the presence of at least some normal BR1 targets seems necessary for the formation of BR2 connections.

These data are consistent with the idea that ectopic BR1 projections develop by sprouting of axon collaterals in response to signals arising from the deafferented nucleus, and that these axons compete with other sets of axons for terminal space in the BR2 .

Parvalbumin is expressed in a reciprocal circuit linking the BR1 and BR2 in the rabbit.

In some cases, there are distinct patches of parvalbumin immunoreactivity within layers III/IV of BR1 that appear similar to the patchy termination of thalamocortical axons labeled by the injection of anterograde tracers into BR2.

Focal injections of the tracers biocytin or biotinylated dextran amine  into the BR1 labeled thalamocortical afferent patches within layer III/IV and retrogradely labeled corticothalamic neurons in layer VIa of the BR2.

These studies provide evidence for the existence of multiple, chemically coded pathways linking BR1 and the BR2.

The BR1 was discriminated physiologically from the BR2  on the basis of neuronal responses with long latency and broad or multipeaked tuning curves.

Together with the physiological findings, the present results suggest that the BR1 is a potentially separate auditory field from auditory field(BR2) and is likely to be involved in both temporal and spectral integration of acoustic information.

The BR1 of macaque monkeys contains a core of primary-like areas surrounded by a narrow belt of associated fields that encompass much of the BR2 in these animals.

By using a series of mouse embryos and fetuses of the hybrid cross B6D2F2/J weighing from 0.36 g to 1.0 g , we examined the spatial and temporal distribution of BR1 projection cells by inserting crystals of the lipophilic dye  into the BR2.

Around 0.4 g or E15.8, retrogradely labeled cells were found restricted to a discrete cluster continuously distributed from the most BR1 to the BR2.

The BR1 and BR2 normally contribute only a few medium-sized terminals .

The lateral vestibulospinal tract projects from an origin in BR1, whereas a possible ascending tract of Deiters arises in BR2.

BR1 contains a nuclear group that appears homologous to the BR2 of fish, reptiles, and birds and thus likely serves gravistatic and linear vestibulomotor reflexes.

The distribution of retrogradely labeled BR1 neurons after BR2 injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was essentially identical to that of neurons staining immunohistochemically for choline acetyltransferase.

This peculiar distribution mimics the locations of pathways by which descending BR1 fibers enter the BR2.

Each BR1 was innervated by a characteristic subset of BR2 neurons, always located in close association with descending cortical fibers.

Double label experiments using retrograde transport of fluorescent dyes confirmed that BR1 neurons innervate restricted BR2.

The distribution of choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity in the brain of G. galloti resembles in many respects that of other vertebrates, and differences are mainly observed in the BR1 and midbrain BR2.

Role of target tissue in regulating the development of BR1 ganglion cells in the albino rat: effects of kainate lesions in the BR2.

While the BR1 or BR2 neurons within the injection site died within 48 hours of the injection, damage to axons and terminals of extrinsic origin within the injected region was not apparent.

By contrast, injections of neurotoxins into the BR1 and/or the optic tract of newborn rats did not result in a significant reduction in the numbers of BR2 ganglion cells surviving the period of naturally occurring ganglion cell death.

The period of sensitivity of BR1 ganglion cells to the injection of neurotoxin into the BR2 extends from birth to about the end of the first postnatal week; the greatest sensitivity seems to be restricted to the first 3-4 postnatal days.

We used the electron microscope to examine lamina I trigemino- and spinothalamic  terminations in the BR1  of the macaque BR2.

Small branches of the BR1 were labeled so as to determine the somatotopic organization in the BR2 .

The BR1 is divided into four segments from BR2 .

Up to 3 weeks postlesion the response to stimulation of BR1 consisted of a brief latency spike in interneuron A, similar to that in control animals and to stimulation of the intact BR2.

Thus, the present data point out a peculiar neurochemical pattern of the BR1 asymmetry in the frog, suggesting that nitric oxide may be involved in the developmental shaping which leads to an asymmetrical configuration of the BR2.

This latter finding supports the postulated relationship of the BR1 asymmetry with the occurrence of the BR2.

The finding of beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate -diaphorase histochemical reactivity confined to a distinct portion of the BR1 prompted a reexamination of the cytoarchitecture of the developing and mature BR2 in the frog.

When do the developing connections between mammalian BR1 ganglion cells and the BR2 become functional?

Synaptic activity was first recorded from the BR1 at 45 days, and was found to be progressively more caudal, spreading to cover the BR2, by 65 days.

The ability of BR1 fibres to sustain action potentials precedes their formation of functional synapses with BR2 neurons, which happens abruptly at three months before eye opening.

Changes in synaptic density after developmental compression or expansion of BR1 input to the BR2.

The anterior group, in the BR1 and the BR2, contains the largest population of serotoninergic neurons.

These neurons are not confined to the BR1 near the midline, but rather expand laterally in the BR2.

The early development of the BR1 and BR2 in embryonic rat.

In the BR1 and BR2, large extracellular spaces resemble the oriented channels previously described in the mouse.

In the BR1 and BR2 of the rat, similar spaces are not present, but the timed autolysis of neuroepithelial cells could provide a pathway of minimal resistance for the earliest axons.

Degenerating cells are prominent in the BR1 and BR2 prior to the arrival of the first optic axons that preferentially invade these regions.

In one strain of rat, Manchester Hooded, the BR1 are heavily pigmented, but little pigment is seen at any stage in the stalk; in albinos, pigment is absent from both BR2 and stalk.

Long-term depression  can also be induced in BR1 and BR2 during the time at which these pathways are refined, and this Long-term depression is partially dependent on nitric oxide and L-type Ca channel function.

The second group, which reaches the BR1 by P3, arises from new neurons of the same nuclear regions and from scattered cells of the BR2.

Ultrastructural organization of choline-acetyltransferase-immunoreactive fibres innervating the BR1 from embryonic BR2 grafts.

Suspension grafts of foetal tissue rich in cholinergic neurones were transplanted into the BR1 of rats that had previously undergone deafferentation of the extrinsic cholinergic innervation of the cortex by injection of ibotenic acid into the BR2.

The BR1 tissue containing the graft was processed for electron microscopic immunocytochemistry by using a monoclonal antibody to choline acetyltransferase  in order to examine the contacts established between cholinergic fibres from the graft and the host BR2.

choline acetyltransferase -positive fibres in both grafted and control animals formed extensive synaptic connections with various BR1 neural elements--those of graft origin being of similar morphology to those in the intact BR2.

The spines of cells located in the BR1  were found to be less complex than those of cells located rostrally in this BR2 .

Cells afferent to the BR1 were identified by retrograde horseradish peroxidase transport in the following BR2.

The termination of the BR1 efferents in the BR2 was studied in the rat by using the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin .

However, the bulk of the BR1 fibers appeared to terminate in the BR2 and exhibited a discrete dorsoventral topographical pattern.

The terminal plexus displayed patches of uneven density, which was partly due to the numerous fiber bundles passing through the BR1, but also to an obvious preference of BR2 fibers for some cells.

In addition to a lack of melanin in the BR1 pigment epithelium , the albino BR2 is characterized by abnormal patterns of cell proliferation and cellular organization during development as well as cell-type specific deficits in the adult.

In adults they primarily innervate BR1, including the BR2 .

the BR1 and BR2.

Szabo, '62, '67, '70, '72) and the dorsoventral axis is inverted in the projection of the BR1 onto the BR2 but not in the striatopallidal projection .

We did not observe changes in neurofilament expression in BR1 or in BR2 in the contexts of hearing song or singing, although these contexts result in marked induction of the transcription factor ZENK.

This observation suggests that neurofilament might not be under the regulatory control of ZENK in BR1 or in BR2.

Two other imprinting-related areas, the BR1  and BR2 , do show c-fos induction; however, the areas are not congruous with those demarcated by the 2-DG autoradiographic studies.

In addition, c-fos is induced by first courtship and chasing in neurosecretory cell groups of the BR1 and BR2 associated with the repertoire of sexual behavior and stress or enhanced arousal.

Avulsion of a part of the BR1 has similar effects as destruction of the BR2.

Galanin-positive synapses were most prominent on choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons in the BR1 and in the BR2, which is where there was the greatest overlap between the distribution of galanin-immunoreactive terminals and choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons.

Four locations were studied, including three on the BR1 and one on the BR2.

However, it remains unclear whether or not these pathways converge onto BR1 neurones in the border zone between BR2.

Microinjections of dextran-tetramethylrhodamine and dextran-fluorescein were made into the BR1, and labelled terminals in the BR2 were examined in the same sections.

In this common projection zone, however, BR1 and BR2 terminals seldom intermingled, and they mostly occupied separate, discreet areas.

medialis, projects directly to the BR1 and to the BR2.

BR1 receives input from BR2 as well as from a number of sites within the CNS: n.

praeeminentialis pars ventralis, and the BR1 and BR2.

The BR1 terminates in a column of five BR2.

Of these, only the BR1 maintain a direct but sparse projection to the BR2.

This nucleus receives input from the BR1 and projects bilaterally to the BR2.

It is suggested that the BR1 is homologous to portions of the BR2 of other vertebrates.

Serotoninergic fibers have been reported in both the BR1 and BR2 of the cat.

To resolve the issue of whether these two populations of neurons overlap, serotoninergic fibers were assayed in the BR1 and BR2; then the morphologies and distributions of identified serotoninergic neurons and oculomotor internuclear neurons were determined.

Following injection of horseradish peroxidase into either the BR1 or BR2, double-label immunohistochemical techniques demonstrated that the serotoninergic and oculomotor internuclear neurons form two distinct cell populations.

The latter were located in the BR1 along its dorsal border and in the adjacent BR2.

In the BR1, they are dispersed through the BR2, with many axons approaching the midline and then turning back to enter the same side of the brain as the originating eye.

In marsupials, by contrast, uncrossed axons never approach the midline; instead, they remain grouped in the BR1 and BR2.

We found that the Cajal-Retzius cells are most likely generated in the BR1 by comparing with other BR2 or extracortical origins.

From their site of origin in the BR1, they spread in a caudorostral direction, following an oblique migratory path toward the BR2.

BR1 on the human BR2.

Evoked potentials  to auditory click-train stimulation presented binaurally were recorded chronically from penetrating electrodes implanted in BR1 , from pial-surface electrodes placed on the BR2 , or from both simultaneously, in awake humans undergoing surgery for medically intractable epilepsy.

Evoked potentials recorded simultaneously from BR1 and BR2 differed in their sensitivities to general anesthesia and to changes in rate of stimulus presentation.

Results indicate that the acoustically active region on the BR1 is a separate auditory area, functionally distinct from the BR2 auditory field.

We refer to this acoustically sensitive area of the BR1 as the BR2 .

BR1 branches of thick olivocochlear axons were labeled by injections of horseradish peroxidase into the BR2 turn in mice.

We find exactly equal numbers of Muller cell trunks and BR1 cone terminals, which may make the BR2 particularly vulnerable to Muller cell dysfunction.

Sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the BR1 of the cat were identified by intracellular recording and antidromic activation from the corresponding BR2.

It seems likely that the strong physiological correlates of soma size which have been described among cat BR1 ganglion cells and among the relay cells of the macaque BR2 are generally present in primates.

At the BR1, ganglion cells are smaller in soma size than in BR2; they also seemed more uniform in size, although some distinctly larger cells persist in the human and bushbaby.

Thus the primate BR1 examined show features, such as the BR2 specialization, which seem unique to them among mammals.

Morphology of thalamocortical neurons projecting to the BR1 and their relationship to BR2 terminals in the squirrel monkey.

Additionally, connectivity was analyzed in seven rats in which BR1 and/or BR2 projections to the area were labeled anterogradely with either 3H-leucine or wheat-germ agglutinin conjugated to HRP, and the animals were perfused and processed following various histological procedures .

BR1 and corticothalamic afferents originating from the host were observed in the neonucleus when the fetal neurons had been implanted correctly into the lesioned area but not when they had been misplaced into either normal BR2 tissue or the internal capsule.

In an effort to determine how BR1 cells are generated and spatially organized within BR2 regenerated after ouabain injection, in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical techniques were combined with computational analyses of two-dimensional spatial patterns of identified neurons.

The spatial patterns of inner BR1 neurons in experimental eyes were also disorganized with respect to native BR2.

Subsequent to this time, labeling of Muller cells is significantly more robust, resulting in Muller cell domination of BR1 autoradiographic patterns in more mature BR2.

We conclude that the ability of BR1 cells to accumulate 3H-GABA does not remain constant during postnatal development; rather each cell population displays a unique maturation sequence that results in a dramatic developmental shift in the number and types of GABA-accumulating cells present in the BR2.

BR1 lesions resulted in a partial loss of 3H-nicotine binding in BR2.

In each BR1 lesion group, the greatest decrease  occurred within the BR2 and area (i.e.

Saturation analysis, performed in BR1 tissue homogenates following BR2 lesions, revealed a significant  reduction in receptor density but not affinity.

Direct excitotoxic lesions of the BR1 (BR2) tended to preserve 3H-nicotine binding in layers 3/4, despite local neuronal loss.

This organizing principle appears to apply not only to sensory and motor relay projections but also to BR1 that project to BR2.

Projections to contralateral ganglia, the BR1, and the BR2 were also examined.

Counts of labelled neurons yielded estimated totals of 1,700-1,800 BR1 and 400-500 BR2 efferent neurons.

Effects of estrogen replacement therapy on cholinergic BR1 neurons and BR2 cholinergic innervation in young and aged ovariectomized rhesus monkeys.

The present study tested the hypothesis that estrogen enhances the phenotype of cholinergic BR1 neurons and their BR2 cholinergic innervation in young adult and aged ovariectomized rhesus monkeys.

These data indicate that estrogen administered in a manner simulating natural hormonal cyclicity produces modest age-specific chemical phenotypic and regional changes in select neuronal subfields of the cholinergic BR1 and their BR2 projection sites in nonhuman primates.

In the adult rat BR1, perineuronal nets are found around large, BR2  neurons and Golgi neurons and are composed of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans , tenascin-R , hyaluronan , and link proteins, such as cartilage link protein 1 .

Significantly greater numbers of activated neurons expressing the Neuropeptide FF gene  were observed in the BR1 at the level of the BR2 in animals receiving intracerebroventricular(i.c.v.

Whereas the two latter areas contain dense terminal networks, the BR1 is occupied primarily by 5-HT fibers en route to other parts of the BR2.

Where fluorescent retrograde tracing was performed with 5-HT immunohistochemistry on the same tissue section, a prominent 5-HT containing pathway and a non-5-HT-containing pathway from the BR1 to the BR2 were revealed.

In this study, we examined whether the chloramphenicol enhancement of deafferentation-induced cell death reveals the same ultrastructural characteristics that are seen in degenerating BR1 neurons after BR2 removal alone.

The percentage of BR1 neurons displaying ribosomal disintegration following BR2 removal was found to be markedly increased after chloramphenicol treatment.

In the BR1 of mice homozygous for the BR2 degeneration slow  gene, receptor outer segments failed to develop and typical disc structures were never observed.

At the time when outer segments grew in the normal BR1, the BR2 in the mutant showed an accumulation of membrane-bound vesicles of varying size and density.

The distribution of catecholaminergic and cholinergic neurons in the BR1 of the ferret were mapped by staining immunohistochemically two adjacent series of sections of BR2 for tyrosine hydroxylase and choline acetyltransferase, respectively.

Choline-acetyltransferase-positive neurons distributed in the BR1 (BR2) are smaller than the cholinergic cells of Ch5, and they stain less intensely for choline acetyltransferase.

Caudally, the BR1 neurons extend some considerable extent into the BR2.

In conclusion, the ferret has a typically carnivore pattern for the distribution of catecholaminergic cells in the BR1, and there is a significant overlap between the catecholaminergic and cholinergic cell groups in the BR2.

Most prominent Slack immunoreactivity occurs in the BR1, in particular the trigeminal system and BR2, where very intense staining was found in both cell bodies and axonal fibers of associated nuclei.

Within the BR1, the BR2 had a robust signal consistent with staining of the giant presynaptic terminals.

The only BR1 in which Slack immunoreactivity was detected was the BR2.

gamma-aminobutyric acid ergic bipolar cells in the BR1, a BR2 devoted to feedback in the electrosensory system, project in relatively diffuse fashion to pyramidal cells.

To understand the functional relevance of the BR1 as a major distributor of BR2 processed information, detailed information about its neuronal organization is necessary.

Because all four different regions of the BR1 share this paucity of collateralized projections, we conclude that BR2 outputs generally originate as parallel projections.

Histochemical localization of cytochrome oxidase in the BR1 and BR2 of normal goldfish: a combined cytochrome oxidase-horseradish peroxidase study.

Cytochrome oxidase  was histochemically localized in the normal BR1 and BR2 of goldfish in order to examine the laminar and cellular oxidative metabolic organization of these structures.

In SFGSd, intense reactivity was found to occur specifically within a class of large diameter axons and terminals that were apparently BR1 since these were also labeled with HRP and cobaltous lysine applied to the BR2.

Like the large diameter BR1 terminals in SFGSd, the large ganglion cells were preferentially filled with HRP, suggesting that they may project to BR2 and are the source of the darkly reactive large diameter axons and terminals in sublamina SFGSd.

The BR1 projection to the BR2 in the pigeon .

The BR1 of the pigeon receiving direct vestibular afferents was delineated by anterograde transport of [3H]-amino acids injected into the BR2.

A few solitary labelled rosettes were also found in more BR1, as well as in the BR2.

Discrete injections of [3H]-leucine into the cristae of each of the three BR1 or the BR2 yielded a similar distribution of fewer labelled rosettes.

A few primary mossy fiber terminals labelled after BR1 injections are attributed to afferents from the BR2.

BR1 projections and nigrothalamocortical pathway to the BR2 in the rat: single- and double-labeling light and electron microscopic studies.

The greatest concentration of labeled cell bodies was found in the BR1 and the adjacent area of BR2.

A second intensely labeled region was found in BR1 and BR2.

Together with previous electrophysiological and neuroanatomical studies, the findings suggest that the BR1 provides an integrating link between BR2 and certain modalities of sensory information.

By using BR1 imaging of intrinsic signals, we compared the maps of orientation and spatial frequency  preference between central  and paracentral  BR2 in the prosimian bush baby .

We demonstrated that spatial frequency was represented continuously across BR1, and that the map of spatial frequency preference exhibited eccentricity-dependent variations, with more territory devoted to higher spatial frequency s in central than in BR2.

Integrity of the BR1 in BR2 xenografts is correlated with the immunological status of the host.

The purpose of this study was to determine the immunological correlates of BR1 breakdown in BR2 xenografts in rats by utilizing skin grafting to initiate a timed immune response to the transplanted neural tissue.

Embryonic day 13-14 CD-1 mouse BR1 were grafted into the BR2 of neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats.

Distribution in BR1 of neurons projecting to the BR2: a quantitative study in the cat with retrograde transport of HRP-WGA.

Furthermore, BR1 representing the lower part of the visual field have a higher cell density than those representing the upper part; in four cases, 68-86% of all labeled cells were found in parts of BR2 representing the visual field below the horizontal meridian.

Since there is an enlarged BR1 representation of central vision, the much lower cell densities in "central" parts of BR2 than in "peripheral" parts may mean that all parts of the visual field are represented with equal numbers of corticopontine neurons .

This is not the case, however, since the number of labeled cells per 10 degrees X 10 degrees is considerably higher in the BR1 representing the central 10 degrees and medial parts of the lower visual field than in the rest of BR2.

Assuming that the corticopontine cells in the BR1 transmit spatially relevant information, we conclude that there is an overrepresentation of central vision and the medial parts of the lower visual field in the corticopontine projection from BR2.

The BR1 contains two widely recognized BR2.

The BR1 projects to the BR2.

The posterior area contains the BR1 and a dorsal arm of this nucleus, often placed in the BR2, was recognized.

We have tentatively placed the BR1 in the BR2.

In the present study, parvalbumin immunocytochemistry  and stereological methods were used to obtain estimates of BR1 volume, total neuron number, laminar density, and the percentage of Parvalbumin -immunoreactive neurons in BR2.

Based on a mean BR1 thickness of 1.92 mm, there are approximately 106,000 neurons in a 1 mm2 column of BR2.

Transection of the BR1 or the BR2 resulted in the loss of expression of these molecules from the gustatory epithelium, indicating that they are expressed only on differentiated taste cells.

The blood group antigens are lactoseries carbohydrates; they are differentially expressed in developing BR1 hair cells and BR2 neurons and may play roles in cell-cell recognition, adhesion, and other interactions important in the developing nervous system.

Double-labeled neurons, however, were not observed after double tracer injections into BR1 and BR2 .

Partial topographical segregation of the two populations was observed along the dorsoventral axis because BR1-projecting neurons exhibited maximum density ventral to that of BR2 neurons.

BR1 cells to the BR2 had cell body diameters between 16 and 48 microns.

Laminar origin of BR1 neurons which project upon the BR2: a horseradish peroxidase investigation in the cat.

The horseradish peroxidase method was used to study the BR1 projections upon the BR2 in the cat.

The cells of origin of the corticostriatal projection arise from both the BR1, in contrast to all other known corticofugal pathways to BR2, which appear to arise only from the infragranular layers.

Projections to the BR1 from BR2 in the rat.

Orthograde axonal transport tracing methods were used to describe the projections to the BR1  which arise within the face representation of BR2.

In contrast, the projections from BR1 largely terminate in BR2 areas separate from those receiving either limb sensorimotor or motor face inputs.

Double immunofluorescence staining revealed that dopaminergic cells generally do not stain for DARPP-32, except for cells in the BR1 and at BR2 levels.

In addition, postembedding immunoelectron microscopy reveals that GluR2 is present in synapses of BR1 neurons and that the percentage of labeled synapses and numbers of immunogold particles per synapse do not vary between these BR2 regions.

These observations suggest that ovine corticotropin releasing factor-like immunoreactivity material might be involved in the BR1 control of BR2 hormone secretion in birds, and that neurophysin- and ovine corticotropin releasing factor-like immunoreactivity -producing nerve cells might be functionally coupled.

Axotomy-induced neuronal death and reactive astrogliosis in the BR1 following a lesion of the BR2 in the rat.

More than 95% of the neurons in the BR1 survive during the first 3 days following a lesion of the BR2.

Three days after a lesion of the BR1, the mean cross-sectional areas of BR2 neurons are 13% smaller than normal .

Astrocytes in the BR1 also react to BR2 damage.

At 1 day after a lesion of the BR1, glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity in the BR2 is almost undetectable, but a distinct increase in immunoreactivity is seen at 3 days.

Thus, following a lesion of the BR1, the somata of neurons in the BR2 remain essentially normal morphologically for about 3 days before the onset of rapid atrophy and death.

BR1 connections of the BR2 in the squirrel monkey .

The afferent BR1 connections to BR2 important for control of head movement in space were analysed by intracortical retrograde tracer injections.

Anatomical evidence is presented that the BR1 is a special compartment within this BR2.

The BR1, mainly involved in visual-optokinetic signal processing, receives a substantial input from the BR2.

Some overlap in the BR1 projecting to these areas with those projecting to the BR2 was found.

A quantitative evaluation of BR1 projecting to different BR2 was performed by constructing so-called "thalamograms.

Following such injections, labeling is present within extensive regions of both the BR1 and BR2, where it presents a mottled or meshlike appearance.

Transported tracer is also present within the BR1, where it is most abundant within the BR2.

In a separate series of experiments, horseradish peroxidase was injected into the BR1-specifically into the BR2.

The prenatal development of the rabbit's BR1 projections to the BR2  was studied by using anterograde transport of horseradish peroxidase injected intraocularly.

On embryonic day 21 contralaterally projecting BR1 fibers invade across the entire BR2 .

Ipsilaterally projecting BR1 fibers invade the BR2 on embryonic day 21 .

On E29 the ipsilateral terminal field forms distinct patches and bands that are restricted to the BR1 and are confined to the BR2.

The early widespread distribution of the ipsilaterally projecting BR1 fibers to the BR2 and their eventual restriction in the fetal rabbit are consistent with the development of this projection in other mammalian orders.

BR1: inhibition and excitation in the ipsilateral and contralateral projections of BR2.

When this series of experiments was begun in 1984, the activity of each BR1  in the mammalian BR2 was known to encode the hemifield of acoustic space containing a sound source.

The BR1  of macaque monkeys is a large but little understood region of the BR2.

On the medial wall, BR1 have been delineated, in addition to BR2.

Just as the area-specific neurophysiological properties of these BR1 underlie broader regional functions such as visuospatial analysis, it is likely that the many small areas of the BR2 also make differential contributions to the general mnemonic, sensory, and affective functions of this region.

In addition, because these nuclei lie directly in the path of corticofugal and corticopetal axons during development, we have examined the relationship of these growing axons to the BR1 and BR2 cell groups.

Neurones were labelled by applying DiI, wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase , or HRP to the BR1 and/or BR2 of rats at different stages of development.

The axons of neurons in the BR1 reach the BR2 as early as embryonic day  14.

At this age, and during later prenatal development, a small DiI implant limited to the presumptive BR1 labels reticulothalamic and thalamocortical axons which travel in a clearly defined bundle through the BR2.

The BR1 is very large at a stage when the first thalamocortical axons leave and when the first corticothalamic axons approach the BR2.

Corticothalamic axons turn toward the BR1, and thalamocortical axons turn toward the BR2 subplate.

Our results demonstrate that the majority of zincergic projections to the BR1 arose from ipsilateral and callosal neurons, situated in BR2 layers 2/3 and 6.

BR1 projections were mainly to the BR2 by way of a lateral descending trigeminal tract (lTTD; Dubbeldam and Karten [1978] J. Comp.

No projections were seen to the BR1 or to the BR2.

A large amount of Glutamic acid decarboxylase -positive reaction product was observed in both the BR1 and BR2 in light microscopic preparations and was localized ultrastructurally to axon terminalis that surrounded dendrites and large somata.

In the BR1 the relative numbers of Glutamic acid decarboxylase -positive axons terminals per unit area were substantially less than in the BR2.

Glutamic acid decarboxylase -positive reaction product was also localized within the somata and dendrites of BR1 and BR2 neurons in colchicine-injected preparations.

The Glutamic acid decarboxylase -positive somata in the BR1 were medium-sized neurons and since such cells project to the BR2, our results are in agreement with those from other studies which demonstrate a gamma-aminobutyric acid ergic, pallidonigral pathway.

BR1 efferents through the BR2 in the rat give origin to zinc-containing boutons.

Lesions in the BR1 or in the BR2 did not produce bleaching of the stain for zinc in the above-mentioned terminal fields.

On the day of birth , barrelettes are manifested as longitudinal, histochemical cylinders in BR1, BR2 .

Recent evidence shows that other vibrissal representations--BR1 barreloids and BR2 barrels--also follow these "afferent-before-target" and "row-before-individual units" sequences of development.

The effect of BR1 and BR2 lesions on the visual fields of binocularly deprived cats.

Unilateral occipito-temporal cortical ablations  also had no affect on the visual fields, but subsequent ablations of the BR1 produced permanent blindness in the hemifield contralateral to the ablated BR2.

A light and electron microscopic study of the effects of 3-acetylpyridine intoxication on the BR1 and BR2.

The effects of 3-acetylpyridine  intoxication on the BR1 and BR2 of the rat were examined at both the light and electron microscopic level.

The sensitivity of the olivocerebellar system to 3-acetylpyridine thus provides a convenient and selective means of eliminating all of the BR1 neurons and their axons, the climbing fibers of the BR2.

The origin, density and distribution of calcitonin gene-related peptide  immunoreactivity in BR1 and the BR2 ganglion of rats were examined in this study.

The present study demonstrates that calcitonin gene-related peptide , a putative neurotransmitter/neuromodulator, is especially abundant in the BR1 circulation and is derived from the BR2.

The first mutant, split eye, had no connections between the BR1 and the BR2.

The other mutant, spindle, had reduced BR1 that innervated reduced BR2 with a normal-appearing orderly arrangement of neurons.

Our findings confirm that afferent BR1 input is essential for normal differentiation and maintenance of many BR2 interneurons.

The organization of certain afferents to the BR1 and BR2 in normal and reeler mice.

The organization of certain of the major afferents to the BR1 and BR2 has been studied in normal and reeler mutant mice using the autoradiographic and the anterograde degeneration methods.

However, there are a number of significant differences in their distribution; for example, in the reeler mouse, the BR1 afferents occupy the entire radial extent of the BR2, whereas in normal mice they are restricted to the outer four-fifths of this layer.

Some of the developmental and functional implications of these and other abnormalities in the organization of the afferents to the BR1 and BR2 are discussed.

The climbing fiber projection to the rat BR1 and adjacent BR2 was investigated by using Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin as an anterograde and horseradish peroxidase as a retrograde tracer.

Physiological and morphological diversity of immunocytochemically defined parvalbumin- and cholecystokinin-positive interneurones in BR1 of the adult rat BR2.

To investigate the electrophysiological properties, synaptic connections, and anatomy of individual parvalbumin-immunoreactive  and cholecystokinin-immunoreactive  interneurones in BR1, dual intracellular recordings using biocytin-filled microelectrodes in slices of adult rat BR2 were combined with fluorescence labelling of PV- and CCK-containing cells.

Six were bistratified cells with axons ramifying throughout BR1  and BR2 .

One was a putative axo-axonic cell with an axonal arbour confined to half of the BR1 and a narrow adjacent region of the BR2 .

The present series of experiments were designed to quantitatively document the response properties of nociceptive neurons in the rat BR1 using the same electrical and innocuous and/or noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli employed in the characterization of nociceptive neurons with orofacial receptive fields in the rat BR2.

On these grounds it could be concluded that muscles active in the contraction phase of respiration are represented in the BR1, the expansion muscles in the BR2.

The axial muscles of a given hemisegment are innervated by two or three primary motoneurons and a larger number of secondary motoneurons in the corresponding BR1, whereas fin muscles are innervated by a pool of motoneurons spanning several BR2.

BR1 lesions induce an increase in cell number and PSA-NCAM expression in the BR2 of adult rats.

We examined cell number and expression of differentiation markers in the BR1 of adult rats after BR2 lesions.

Our results showed that microglial cells were present in all BR1 of both young and adult mice, but their distribution and morphology were not homogeneous throughout the BR2.

This approach revealed separate pre-sympathetic and pre-parasympathetic neurons in the BR1 and BR2.

Next, selective retrograde tracing with two unique reporter pseudorabies virus strains, one injected into the BR1 and the other into the sympathetic denervated liver, demonstrated that there are two separate populations of pre-sympathetic and pre-parasympathetic neurons within the BR2.

Interestingly, this segregation persists into the BR1 , where, as a result, the day-night balance in autonomic function of the organs is affected by specialized BR2 neurons.

The morphology of single BR1 terminals in the BR2 of the eastern garter snake was demonstrated by orthograde filling from extracellular injections of horseradish peroxidase  into the optic tract.

Single axons exit a fascicle and course into either the BR1, ventrally, or the BR2, dorsally, where they bifurcate successively two or three times into preterminal branches.

Although the existence of BR1 and BR2 has been well documented in anuran amphibians, the exact boundaries of these structures have so far been a matter of debate.

Neurobiotin tracing studies demonstrated that neurons projecting to the BR1 are found in the BR2.

In contrast, borders of the BR1 toward the BR2 were essentially stable.

The organization of cholinergic inputs to cat BR1 (BR2) was studied by using a histochemical stain for acetylcholinesterase .

Because the BR1 projecting cells in this region have been shown to contain choline acetyltransferase in a number of species, we postulate that the acetylcholinesterase -positive fibers we describe in the cat BR2 are in fact cholinergic.

This study utilizes anterograde axonal transport of cobaltous-lysine and conventional silver-staining techniques to study the central projections of the BR1 within the BR2 of the carpet shark Cephaloscyllium isabella.

Both fields appear to be located within the ventral portion of the nuclei indicating an apparent subdivision of the BR1 projections within the BR2.

In the area immediately BR1 a number of labelled primary afferent fibres project to the BR2.

Previous studies have shown that the distribution of BR1 connections in the BR2 of the cat is patchy at a small scale, but the mechanisms that determine this periodic pattern remain unclear.

The present study investigated this issue by correlating the distribution of retrogradely labeled BR1 cells with the underlying patterns of BR2  revealed transneuronally after intraocular injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase.

The results are consistent with the hypothesis that BR1 linkages are stabilized during development by interhemispheric correlated activity driven by bilateral projections from BR2.

Thalamocortical synapses of pyramidal cells which project from BR1 to BR2 in the mouse.

Pyramidal cells in layers II through V of BR1 were labeled by the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase injected into BR2.

The thalamocortical relations of the somatic fields in and around the BR1 of the macaque were studied following BR2 injections of tritated amino acids and horseradish peroxidase .

Special attention was paid to the BR1 , the connections of which were also studied by means of BR2 isotope injections and retrograde degeneration.

Following small injections of isotope or horseradish peroxidase into the hand representation of BR1, only BR2 was labeled.

Comparison of injections involving different body parts in BR1 suggested a somatotopic arrangement within BR2 such that the trunk and lower limb representations are located posterolaterally and the hand and arm representations anteromedially.

MGmc), BR1 , and the BR2 .

BR1 receives its heaviest input from the BR2.

Movement-sensitive, polarization-sensitive, and light-sensitive neurons of the BR1 and BR2 of the locust, Schistocerca gregaria.

Finally, a third class of neurons had tangential arborizations in the BR1 and axonal projections to the lobula and to the BR2.

We mapped the induction of activin betaA mRNA in BR1 and BR2 at several stages of seizure development.

A similar temporal and spatial pattern of increased marker of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic neurons expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor  was found in the BR1 and BR2.

The BR1  contains two physiologically defined types of neurons that participate in the opioid-induced modulation of BR2 nociceptive messages: OFF cells, which decrease, and ON cells, which increase their discharge rates when reflex behavior is evoked by noxious pinch or heat.

the BR1 contained only neurokinin B cells whereas the BR2 had only substance P cells.

Furthermore, activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated protein was found exclusively in non-GABAergic alpha-CaMKII-positive BR1 and BR2 neurons of rats that had explored a novel environment.

Some observations on BR1 inputs to the macaque monkey BR2: an anterograde tracing study.

We have charted, based on the results of 33 separate injections, the topographic distribution of BR1 projections throughout the BR2.

Both the circumferential band of cells and the cells in the body of the BR1 give off axonlike processes that run in the inner plexiform layer and do not enter the BR2.

The BR1, which contains only rare immunoreactive cell bodies, has a plexus of stained fibers comparable to that of the BR2.

We found that CB1- CB1-immunoreactive axons innervated densely the majority of BR1, except for the BR2, in which only scattered CB1- CB1-immunoreactive fibers occurred.

CB1- CB1-immunoreactive innervation of the BR1 and the BR2 corroborated the important role of CB1 in the regulation of energy homeostasis and neuroendocrine functions.

In conclusion, the study revealed the dense and differential CB1- CB1-immunoreactive innervation of most BR1 and the BR2 of the mouse brain.

The regional distribution of intrinsic projections within the BR1 was related to the location of the cells of origin along the BR2.

Cells located in the BR1 gave rise to intrinsic connections that largely remained within the BR2, i.e.

within the BR1 of cells that projected to BR2.

Cells located in the BR1 gave rise to intrinsic projections confined to the BR2.

These results suggest that BR1 intrinsic connections allow for both integration  and segregation  of BR2 information processing.

Catecholaminergic axonal varicosities identified by immunocytochemical staining for dopamine-beta-hydroxylase were observed at the light microscopic level apposing the somata of retrogradely labeled BR1 tract neurons in the monkey BR2.

We also found dense transverse fibers in the BR1 and BR2, which suggests bilateral innervation of the histaminergic system.

The greater part of the BR1 is postulated to form from two separate anlagen which can be clearly distinguished in the BR2 by E13 and E14.

One lies in the anterior ventromedial wall and presumably forms the BR1, BR2.

The other lies in the posterior ventrolateral ridge and presumably forms the BR1 and the BR2.

in the BR1 outside the BR2 afferent receiving territory.

The convergence is defined as the extent of an afferent structure that contains neurons converging on a line normal to the BR1 in BR2.

The results show that a number of BR1 project to BR2 in a nontopographic manner, i.e.

Much larger convergence and divergence values are found in the projections from the BR1 and the BR2.

For example, the divergence reaches 20 mm for the projections from BR1 or from the BR2.

Taste pathways to BR1 and BR2.

Labelled axons collect in the central tegmental tract and ascend to the BR1 in the BR2.

The majority of the fibers remain ipsilateral, but a few cross in the BR1 and BR2.

Labelled axons grandually penetrate through the BR1, and ramify throughout the underlying BR2.

At the BR1 labelled fibers are visible in one component of the BR2.

These fibers can be followed over the BR1 into a smaller, but equally dense terminal area in the BR2.

The electrophysiological data demonstrate that BR1 gustatory units can be antidromically activated by electrodes located in or near the BR2.

The results of this study are in agreement with evidence of neurogenesis of granular neurons in the adult rat BR1 and BR2 .

In some sections, substance P-positive fibers were found primarily in areas of the BR1 containing small neurons, indicating that such fibers may be involved in functions of the BR2 associated with nociceptive projection neurons and/or local circuit neurons.

Twelve BR1l motoneurons stained with horseradish peroxidase were antidromically activated by stimulation applied to the BR2.

We have found that the midbrain BR1 is a major terminal zone for BR2 efferent projections.

Multiple injections produced patchy anterograde and retrograde labelling in the BR1, with the number of patches corresponding to the number of BR2 sites injected.

Single injections produced labelling in restricted regions of the BR1, the location of which varied systematically with the location of the BR2 injection site.

In comparison with the BR1 , BR2 neuroblasts were quite rare on ED 14 and were present only in layer VI.

In the BR1 the last neurons arose between ED 18 and ED 20, and in the BR2 , with the possible exception of a few granular neurons , proliferation continued until the end of gestation.

In the BR1 , and partly also in the BR2 , an inside-out pattern of proliferation and neuron formation was confirmed.

The basic structural organization of axonal projections from the small but distinct BR1 (of the BR2) was analyzed with the Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin anterograde tract tracing method in adult male rats.

At the level of the BR1 , projections from its lateral part crossed the midline and terminated in the BR2 .

One tract coursed dorsolaterally from the BR1 to terminate in the BR2.

The second tract coursed ventrally and rostrally over the BR1 toward the BR2.

Some of these fibers terminated upon neurons of the BR1 and the BR2.

The remaining fibers within the BR1 coursed anteriorly to enter the BR2.

These fibers terminated in the BR1 and BR2.

In long penetrations down the anterior wall of the BR1 we were able to advance the electrode tangentially through BR2.

Projections from the BR1 to the BR2 of the rat: a light and electron microscopic study using single and double anterograde labelling.

Efferent fibres from both nuclei project predominantly to areas of the BR1, which in turn project to the BR2.

In this study, single and double anterograde-tracing techniques have been used to examine and compare the pathways from the BR1 to the BR2 in the rat by using both light and electron microscopy to look for evidence of organisational or structural features that may underlie the proposed functional differences between these nuclei.

The structure of terminals from the BR1, however, as well as their synaptic relationship with BR2 neurones, were found to be similar.

A monoclonal antibody recognizing the p75 receptor for nerve growth factor  was used to assess the immunohistochemical expression of nerve growth factor receptors within the developing human BR1 as well as the BR2.

nerve growth factor receptor-immunoreactive subplate neurons displayed a topographic distribution with the heaviest concentration found within BR1 as well as association BR2.

The expression of nerve growth factor receptor-immunoreactivity increased within the BR1 culminating in intense BR2 staining.

As the BR1 merged with the developing BR2, there was a marked reduction in staining intensity.

The incipient BR1 is present at fetal day  100 as the only part of the BR2 that contains five distinct layers, including a single layer of cone photoreceptors.

A BR1 begins to form at fetal day 135 in the center of the BR2 which is surrounded by a ring of blood vessels  and astrocytes.

At birth  the BR1 has a single layer of cones over the pit center where the inner BR2 layers are thinned but still separated.

After birth the BR1 rapidly matures so that BR2 morphology are similar to adult by 4 months.

Simple and complex BR1 ganglion cell axonal rearrangements at the BR2.

BR1 ganglion cell axons, located initially at the caudal edge of the tract, move toward and come to be positioned laterally to, the column of BR2 ganglion cell axons.

The column of BR1 ganglion cell axons moves from the rostral to the lateral side of the column of BR2 ganglion cell axons.

Furthermore, the rearrangements that occur do not involve any alterations in the positions of BR1 ganglion cell axons with respect to the surface of the BR2.

Expression of the Mecp2e2 splice variant became largely restricted to nuclei within the BR1  and BR2 layer V in juvenile animals, a pattern that was maintained into adulthood.

Unlike prior studies, our study focused on the BR1 and BR2 , because they are involved in social behaviors and may underlie behavioral differences between the species.

Meadow voles had a higher density of cells labeled with the cell proliferation marker 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine  in the BR1 and BR2 than did prairie voles.

Furthermore, the majority of the 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine -labeled cells in the BR1 and BR2 displayed either a neuronal or a glial progenitor phenotype, but no species or treatment differences were found in the percentage of neuronal or glial progenitor cells.

Stimulus-evoked metabolic activity in the BR1 (BR2) occurs in the form of column-like patches.

If a type of projection connecting BR1 transmits sensory information among these BR2, the resultant projection pattern may directly contribute to the definition of somatosensory metabolic "columns.

To test this possibility, electrophysiological recordings in BR1 of Macaca fascicularis monkeys characterized stimuli that elicited the best neuronal response at a specific BR2 site.

After injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase into physiologically defined loci in BR1, the patches of transported label within BR2 were colocalized with evoked metabolic activity.

Patches of anterograde label found in BR1 after BR2 injections, however, were not coincident with the metabolically activated patches.

These findings suggest that excitatory information is transmitted from BR1 to BR2 in a way that connects clusters of cells with similar response properties.

The patterns of BR1 5'-nucleotidase activity in these animals were compared in serial sections to the patterns of calbindin-D28k immunoreactivity and of 3H-naloxone ligand binding, which respectively mark the known matrix and striosome  compartments of the BR2.

The nucleus gave rise to indirect descending pathways to a BR1 where dendrites of crest cells in the BR2 population ramify.

Unlike most vertebrates that have the BR1 and BR2 as two separate pouches ventral to the utricle, the lungfish has a single large ventral pouch that contains a single large pasty otoconial mass.

This mass covers two hair cell patches, each like a striola with prominent hair cell ciliary bundles, that are presumed to represent BR1 and BR2 maculae.

The more caudal BR1 striola is a vertically elongated stripe with hair cell orientation vectors facing antiparallel on either side of a midline drawn vertically along the macula, resembling the macula BR2 of some bony fishes but not of tetrapods.

A distribution-free stereological method was applied to compute the size and number of glomeruli either along the BR1 or in the BR2.

The purpose of this study was to identify BR1 receiving convergent sensory inputs from acoustic and BR2 projection systems in the rat.

Topography of BR1 projections to the BR2 in rats: multiple overlapping sensorimotor pathways.

In rodents, the whisker representation in BR1 projects to the BR2, but the location of these projections has never been characterized with respect to layer IV barrels and their intervening septa.

To address this issue, we injected a retrograde tracer into the BR1 and then reconstructed the location of the labeled corticostriatal neurons with respect to the cytochrome oxidase -labeled barrels in BR2.

In the BR1, gradients of neuropil immunostaining define four major territories: The first  includes all but the BR2 and is characterized by enhanced matriceal parvalbumin and SMI-32 immunoreactivity .

The BR1, one of the BR2, displays the highest concentration of binding.

In the BR1, a moderate density of binding is detected in the BR2.

Angiotensin converting enzyme is heterogeneously distributed in the BR1 and BR2, with distinct patches of high concentration surrounded by a matrix of diffuse, lower levels.

prior to pseudorabies virus inoculation of the spleen, were located in BR1 bilaterally; numerous infected interneurons were also found in the BR2 .

These results demonstrate that the sympathetic outflow to the spleen is controlled by a complex multisynaptic pathway that involves several BR1 and BR2.

Axonal projections from the BR1 to the BR2 of the cat: a study using electron microscopic autoradiography.

The output of these nuclei is direct to the BR1, where binaural inputs synapse with monaural afferents such as those from the BR2.

Despite the importance of the BR1 pathways for binaural information processing, little is known about their synaptic organization in the BR2.

The present study investigates the structure of the projections from the BR1 to the BR2 at the electron microscopic level.

The results show that the BR1 contributes different patterns of synaptic input to the BR2.

Each projection from the BR1 to the BR2 differs in the number and combinations of endings.

Endings from BR1 terminate densely in the BR2.

All endings from the BR1 terminate much less densely than endings from the BR2.

These data show that the BR1 is a major contributor to the synaptic organization of the BR2.

The ipsilateral projections of the BR1 may produce higher concentrations of R endings than other inputs to the BR2.

Intracellular injection of Lucifer Yellow  was used to study the detailed morphology of the normal visually deprived, and light-deprived BR1 projecting Type I BR2 ganglion cells  in hamsters.

We conclude that visual or light deprivation has no effect on the morphological development of BR1 projecting Type I BR2 ganglion cells in hamsters, and the elimination of the transient features on the Type I retinal ganglion cells during development does not depend on visual experience or light stimulation.

Developing descending neurons of the early Xenopus tail BR1 in the BR2 of early Xenopus.

The concept of an early postnatal critical period of development for the BR1 was assessed by determining in adult cats whether previously established properties of BR2 neurons could be altered by varying the cat's visual experience.

To explore further the possibility that BR1 neurons co-containing somatostatin and neuropeptide Y may be evolutionarily conserved among amniotes, we determined the distribution and co-occurrence of somatostatin and neuropeptide Y in BR2 neurons in pigeons.

Double-label immunofluorescence studies revealed that in BR1 that are comparable to mammalian BR2 (i.e.

In contrast, within the BR1 (including the BR2 and several other structures) neurons labeled only for neuropeptide Y or only somatostatin were more abundant than those containing both neuropeptides.

The morphology of single postsynaptic afferent fibers terminating in the feline BR1 was investigated by using transport of Phasolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin from the BR2 and intraaxonal injections of horseradish peroxidase into identified postsynaptic fibers in the cuneate fasciculus.

Injections of Phaseolus in BR1 and BR2 of both rhizotomized and non-rhizotomized cats gave similar results and confirmed previous observations with other techniques.

BR1 projections of six BR2 in the owl monkey, Aotus trivirgatus.

Anatomical and physiological studies indicate that the amino acid L-glutamate is the excitatory transmitter in sensory afferent pathways to the BR1 and in intraamygdala circuits involving the BR2.

In contrast, expression of the carboxy terminus segment Deletion I is prominent in the BR1 but is not observed in other elements of the BR2.

NADPH-diaphorase-positive neurons have been demonstrated in the inner nuclear layer and ganglion cell layer of the BR1 of different mammalian species, but so far no experiments have been conducted to identify whether these cells are amacrine cells and/or BR2 ganglion cells.

Following unilateral BR1 section, which leads to the retrograde degeneration of BR2 ganglion cells, the numbers of both ND and ND cells did not change significantly for up to 4 months.

In addition, when BR1 ganglion cells were prelabeled retrogradely  and BR2 were then stained for NADPH diaphorase, no double-labeled neurons were detected.

The motor and sensory connections of the BR1 and of its inferior ganglion  have been traced in the BR2 of 32 adult cats with the neuroanatomical methods of horseradish peroxidase  histochemistry and amino acid autoradiography .

The histochemical and autoradiographic experiments showed that the BR1 enters the BR2 from its lateral aspect in multiple fascicles and that it contains three major components--axons of preganglionic parasympathetic neurones, axons of skeletal motoneurons, and central processes of the sensory neurons in the nodose ganglion.

Afferent fibers in the BR1 reached most of the BR2 bilaterally, with the more intense labeling being found on the ipsilateral side.

Labeling of sensory vagal projections was also found in the BR1 of both sides and around neurons of the BR2.

The BR1 is known to be a source of afferents which terminate in layer IV of BR2.

However, combined retrograde transport and immunohistochemical techniques failed to reveal the presence of cholecystokinin-positive neurons in the BR1 that project to BR2.

This distribution of immunoreactive structures suggests a distinctive role of cholecystokinin in BR1 circuitry that is common to every region of BR2.

Most of the labelled somata are situated within three clusters: one below the BR1 and two in the BR2.

Another point is that the numerical density of synapses in the BR1 is approximately that of the BR2.

BR1 shows expression in several BR2 at postnatal day 6 .

In the BR1, cadherin-8 is expressed by several BR2.

When punctate injections of fast blue into the BR1 are paired with restricted injections of a second fluorescent tracer  into the appropriate sector of BR2, the punctate region of remote retrogradely labeled principal neurons is embedded within a topographically restricted longitudinal wedge of retrogradely labeled mitral and tufted cells that project extrinsically to or through pars externa .

The anatomical distribution of neurotensin perikarya and fibers in rat brain, BR1, and BR2 has been studied by immunohistochemistry.

The content of large dense vesicles and synaptic associations with somata and proximal dendrites suggest that a certain proportion of the tyrosine hydroxylase -containing terminals within the BR1 are morphologically distinct from catecholaminergic terminals within the BR2.

Saccadic eye movements in the vertical plane are controlled by the BR1  and the BR2.

Injections of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase  into the area of the BR1 revealed a distinctive subset of retrogradely labeled neurons located in the BR2 .

Injections of biotinylated dextran amine  that included this BR1 region anterogradely labeled axons that projected profusely throughout the BR2 .

In summary, these results strongly suggest that the caudomedial part of the cat BR1 is a BR2 that monosynaptically controls lid movements in conjunction with vertical saccades.

The "early" cells were found in the BR1 at E32-E34 and settled in the BR2.

USA 81:940-944, '84) have shown that the FMRFamide-immunoreactive  cells in the BR1 project to the BR2.

In older frey, tracers were used to fill retinopetal cells in both the BR1 and the BR2.

Counts of these cells demonstrated that over one-third of the adult number of retinopetal cells in the BR1 are present and have axons in the BR2 when the fry is 9 days old, and the percentage grows to one-half by the time the fry is 1 month old.

Development of the retinopetal cells in the BR1 lags behind that of the cells in the BR2.

These results provide the first quantitative assessment of the synaptic architecture of BR1 somatic sensory relay neurons and show the basic organizational pattern exhibited by representatives of the physiological type of relay neurons most commonly encountered in the BR2 nucleus.

A laminar cytoarchitectonic scheme of the BR1 of the rat BR2 is presented in which Rexed's principles for the cat are applied.

Labeled neurons appeared bilaterally in the BR1 following injections in the BR2.

In lamina V labeled neurons were distributed mainly laterally in the BR1 but medially and laterally in the BR2.

In the BR1 laminae VII and VIII neurons were distributed very densely along the BR2, accounting for 30 and 40 of the total labeled neurons, respectively.

Neurons with crossed descending axons were found in laminae V, VII and VIII, in the medial part of lamina VII including the BR1 and close to the BR2.

These neurons may function as the long spinal reflex paths for BR1 synergies and the intercalated paths between the supraspinal descending tracts and the BR2.

BR1 of the primate BR2: a quantitative analysis of neuronal morphology.

Morphology of primary axosomatic endings in the BR1 of the cat: a study of the BR2.

The central axons of Type I spiral ganglion neurons travel in the BR1 and terminate in the BR2.

The ascending branches of these axons innervate the BR1 and give rise to large axosomatic endings, called the BR2, and smaller boutons.

Differential control of BR1 activity by the BR2 in rats: a role for both cholinergic and inhibitory influences.

One site was always in the BR1, and the other was in either the BR2.

Stimulation of a single BR1 site often provoked similar release from the latter two BR2.

Electrical stimulation of the BR1 also modified BR2 neuronal activity.

These data suggest an elaborate control of the BR1 by a mechanism involving both gamma-aminobutyric acid-containing and cholinergic neurons of the BR2 .

In addition, accommodative responses to stimulation of the BR1 were compared before and after an injection of muscimol, an agonist of inhibitory neurotransmitter, into the BR2.

Mossy fibers, labeled by injections into the granule cell layer, terminated on parvalbumin neurons in the BR1 and in BR2.

It is well known that experimentally induced BR1 damage produces structural, physiological, and biochemical alterations in neurons of the BR2.

They also exhibited obvious abnormalities in the BR1, supporting cells, and Reissner's membrane throughout the BR2 and had complete inner and outer hair cell loss in the base.

Although radial fibers emitting collaterals in the lateral segment and in the medial segment of the BR1 have been observed, it has not been possible to observe the same radial fiber emitting collaterals in both BR2 and the prospects of ever doing so are not good.

The radial fibers in the BR1 are continuous with the "comb" bundle fibers and appear to be thinner than the radial fibers in the BR2.

It is not proved; nonetheless, the view expressed here is that the radial fibers are thinner in the BR1 because they may be the same fibers that gave off collaterals in the BR2.

Early BR1 enrichment and deprivation both decrease beta-adrenergic receptor density in the BR2 of the rat.

The density of noradrenergic BR1 projections and beta-adrenergic receptors in the BR2 of the rat increases with age.

Changes in beta-adrenergic receptor density in response to both early learning and BR1 deprivation may be induced by a transient increase in BR2 norepinephrine.

Ultrastructural evidence for direct projections from the BR1 to glycine-immunoreactive neurons in the BR2 in the cat.

At the same time, the BR1 elicits relaxation of the external urethral sphincter  by excitation of gamma-aminobutyric acid -ergic interneurons in the BR2 , which, in turn, inhibit external urethral sphincter motoneurons.

The present study investigated, first, whether there are glycine immunoreactive interneurons in the BR1 and, second, whether they receive direct BR2 afferents.

In total 128 labeled BR1 terminals were found in the BR2 , which contained many round vesicles and asymmetric synapses.

The results demonstrate that the BR1 projects directly to dendrites of interneurons in the BR2 , which are immunoreactive for both glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid .

The mean density of acetylcholine axons was the highest in the BR1 (13.0 m/mm vs. 9.9 and 11.0 m/mm in the BR2, respectively), as was the mean density of acetylcholine varicosities .

The lengths of acetylcholine axons under a 1 mm surface of BR1 were 26.7, 19.7, and 15.3 m in the BR2, respectively, for corresponding numbers of 11.1, 7.7, and 6.4 x 10 acetylcholine varicosities.

In keeping with the notion that the synaptic component of acetylcholine transmission in BR1 is preponderant in layer V, these quantitative data suggest a role for this innervation in the processing of BR2 output as well as input.

Extrapolation of particular features of this system in terms of total axon length and number of varicosities in whole BR1, length of axons and number of varicosities per cortically projecting neuron, and concentration of acetylcholine per axon varicosity, should also help in arriving at a better definition of its roles and functional properties in BR2.

Here, we define some of the features of the DL corticospinal tract by tracing corticospinal tract projections following injections of biotinylated dextran amine into the BR1, assessing the distribution of DL corticospinal tract axons and terminal arborizations in intact mice and in mice in which the main contingent of corticospinal tract axons in the BR2 had been transected.

Tracing of DL corticospinal tract axons in mice with selective lesions of the BR1 revealed that DL corticospinal tract axons arborize extensively throughout the BR2 and that the overall territory that the DL corticospinal tract axons invade is similar to the territory innervated by the corticospinal tract axons in the main tract.

In BR1, the ganglion cells had degenerated because they were axotomized by the BR2 section.

Immunoreactivity was also seen in the cells of layers 2, 3A, 4B, 5, and 6 of BR1 and layers 3 and 5 of BR2.

Subsequently, they lose their tangential orientation, enabling them to make contact with the axons of the BR1  that innervate the whole BR2 .

From here, cells extend around the BR1 and the BR2.

A corresponding dorsoventral asymmetry in myeloarchitecture supports the idea that BR1 is an area that is restricted to BR2 and lacks a complete representation of the visual field.

Transneuronal tracing techniques were used to identify the putative BR1 and BR2 neurons involved in continence and voiding in the female rat.

After both bladder base and bladder body injections, the majority of pseudorabies virus-labelled cells were found in the BR1 and BR2 of L6-S1.

A number of those found in the BR1 resembled the parasympathetic preganglionic neurons; the remaining neurons in the BR2 were presumed to be interneurons.

BR1 projections from the BR2 of the North American opossum: heterogeneity.

The autoradiographic method shows that the above nuclei supply direct innervation to BR1 as well as to laminae V-VIII and X. The BR2 provides additional projections to lamina I and the outer part of lamina II.

Several areas of the BR1 project mainly, and in some cases exclusively, to BR2.

Our results indicate that BR1 projections from BR2 are more complicated than previously supposed.

In the BR1, both the signal intensity and the number of positive cells were higher with the s GnRH-associated peptide probe, whereas sb GnRH-associated peptide mRNA-expressing cells were more numerous and intensely stained in the BR2.

Additionally, the BR1 may mediate more subtle changes in BR2 activity as attentional levels fluctuate during the waking state.

In the BR1 and BR2, we quantitatively analyzed the distribution of muscarinic type 2 receptors using electron microscopy.

We tested this prediction by using quantitative techniques to compare the tangential distribution of BR1 neurons in the BR2 of strabismic cats to that in normally reared cats.

Animals were rendered strabismic surgically at 8-10 days of age and were allowed to survive a minimum of 18 weeks, at which time multiple intracortical injections of the tracer horseradish peroxidase  were used to reveal the distribution of BR1 projecting cells in the BR2.

Although our data from strabismic cats do not differ markedly from those reported previously, we find that the distribution of BR1 cells in the BR2 of these cats does not differ significantly from that in our normally reared control cats.

These results do not bear out the prediction that surgically shifting the visual axes leads to stabilization of juvenile BR1 axons in anomalous places within the BR2.

The BR1 pigment epithelium develops from the outer layer of the BR2 which by E45 consists of a multistratified epithelium.

From the density of radiolabelled cells, and data on the overall density of BR1 pigment epithelium cells in the juvenile BR2, we determined the labelling index.

BR1 pigment epithelium cell genesis begins near the BR2, and proceeds towards the periphery.

Cell division largely ceases in both BR1 and BR2 by E56, at which time labelled cells first begin to appear peripheral to the equator.

A prolonged postnatal period of low density BR1 pigment epithelium cell genesis persists in both BR2.

Comparison of the pattern of expansion of the area containing radiolabelled cells in the BR1 pigment epithelium and BR2 demonstrates a remarkable spatial and temporal correspondence.

Ultrastructure of afferents from the BR1 to the BR2 of rats.

The BR1 and BR2 were then dissected free and processed for electron microscopy by using standard methods.

A survey of the general ultrastructure of BR1 and BR2 revealed many RS profiles  making asymmetric synapses around single, small  or larger  dendrites.

There were no profiles making synapses on other vesicle-filled profiles seen, reflecting the scarcity of interneurons in the BR1 and BR2 of rats.

They were small , contained round vesicles, and made asymmetric synapses with proximal  and, to a lesser extent, distal  dendrites; they formed part of the RS population of the BR1 and BR2 .

Somatosensory and motor representations in BR1 of a primitive mammal : a window into the early evolution of BR2.

Somatosensory maps derived from multiunit microelectrode recordings revealed a complete somatosensory representation of the contralateral body surface within a large region of BR1 (BR2, or S1).

A second representation, the BR1 , was found adjacent and caudolateral to BR2 as a mirror image reversed along the representation of the glabrous snout.

A reversal of somatotopic order and an enlargement of receptive fields marked the transition from BR1 to BR2.

In the BR1, radial glia, BR2, and migratory GABAergic neurons expressed CXCR4.

Tangentially migrating CXCR4-expressing neurons populated the BR1 and started to invade the BR2 at embryonic day 14.

During invasion of the BR1 the orientation of CXCR4-immunoreactive neurons changed gradually from tangential  to radial , which was paralleled by downregulation of SDF-1alpha in the BR2.

In summary, SDF-1alpha is expressed along BR1 but not BR2 migration routes of GABAergic neurons.

Ontogeny of the BR1 and BR2 in Xenopus laevis.

Fibers fasciculate into bundles as they arise in the BR1 and reach the BR2 by NF Stage 32.

Because the BR1 grows in rings at its margins, ganglion cell axons differentiate at the periphery and join the nearest fiber bundles  to reach the BR2.

Wedges of ganglion cells send their axons into a common fascicle which retains its integrity as it leaves the BR1 at the BR2.

About 75 immunoreactive perikarya are grouped into clusters in the BR1 and in the BR2.

BR1 contain immunoreactive fibers arranged perpendicular to the Kenyon cell fibers and matching subcompartments of these BR2.

Role of BR1 projections in the representation of bilateral auditory space in the barn owl's BR2.

The shell surrounds the core and is defined by the terminal field of the BR1, one of the BR2.

Climbing fiber projections from the BR1 to the BR2 were studied in the cat by using retrograde axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase.

The expression and localization of Vesicle associated membrane protein isoforms in the salamander BR1, a major model system for studies of BR2 circuitry, was examined by using immunocytochemical and immunoblotting methods.

The early postnatal development of cholecystokinin-immunoreactive  neurons was analyzed in BR1 and BR2 of cats aged from postnatal day 0 to adulthood.

The first population consists of five cell types which appear perinatally in BR1 and BR2.

The second population consists of two cell types which appear around the end of the second and during the third postnatal week in BR1 and BR2.

Labeled BR1 cells, consisting of multipolar, octopus, and small spindle-shaped cells, were located in spatially restricted laminae stretching the entire rostrocaudal length of the nucleus, while labeled BR2 cells consisting of multipolar, globular, small spindle-shaped and small spherical cells were broadly distributed over the posterior half of the nucleus.

Injections placed in the BR1 resulted in only very few labeled cells in the BR2.

L/M cones appear outside the BR1 by fetal week 21.5 and reach the BR2 edge by fetal week 34-37.

Cones containing both S and L/M opsin  appear around the BR1 shortly after L/M opsin is expressed, are found in more BR2 at older ages, and decrease in number after birth.

In this study, we examine the organization of the BR1 afferents to the BR2 .

In general, BR1 tend to innervate the same BR2 from which they receive their input.

Our results show that the BR1 afferents of the BR2 are topographically organized.

Early T-cell infiltration and microglial activation in periventricular and superficial white matter structures adjacent to BR1 suggested initial recruitment of effector T cells via the BR2 and choroid plexus.

Previous observations indicate that the BR1 receives dopaminergic input from the BR2.

At the ultrastructural level, about 40% of the selected Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin -labeled presynaptic terminals in the BR1 and BR2 were found to establish synaptic specializations with ChAT-containing profiles, most of which on the cell body and proximal dendritic shafts.

Corresponding to the differences in the BR1, the BR2 projections were also asymmetric.

The BR1 projects to 1.8% of the ipsilateral and 0.6% of the BR2.

Growth-associated protein 43 immunoreactivity in the BR1 of the rat BR2 is localized in atrophic C-fiber, and not in sprouted A-fiber, central terminals after peripheral nerve injury.

The BR1 and the BR2 , both of which contain preganglionic neurons, are densely innervated.

The results suggest that the paraventriculo-spinal pathway is particularly related to specific groups of sympathetic and parasympathetic preganglionic neurons, and to the BR1, whick is involved in the relay of ascending nociceptive information through the BR2 tract.

In mouse and rat BR1, [I]-deltorphin-labeled delta opioid receptors binding sites were detected throughout the BR2.

Ultrastructural characterization of the BR1 in the BR2 of the pigeon with special reference to intrinsic mechanoreceptors.

The morphology and distribution of dopaminergic interplexiform cells in adult rat and monkey BR1 were analyzed to determine any correlation with the function of dopamine in the outer BR2 layers.

Their density was higher in the BR1 than in the BR2 of the rat and was especially high in the superior temporal quadrant.

At embryonic day 12  in mice, the expression of Islet1 marks distinctively the ventral portion of the nascent BR1 epithelium encompassing the primordial BR2.

Primary BR1 motor neurons undergo apoptosis after axotomizing BR2 injury.

In order to identify cytochemical traits relevant to understanding excitatory neurotransmission in BR1, we have analyzed in the BR2 the synaptic distribution of aspartate aminotransferase, glutamate, and vesicular zinc, three molecules probably involved in different steps of excitatory glutamatergic signaling.

Neuropeptide Y  at 10-1,000 nM caused a concentration-dependent, long-lasting reduction of excitatory postsynaptic potentials  in the BR1 and the BR2, and an even stronger reduction of population spikes.

There is a dense innervation of BR1 by Neuropeptide Y -immunoreactive axons and terminals, particularly in the BR2.

Male rats were injected with True Blue into the BR1 and with FluoroGold into the BR2.

Expression of c-Fos was prominent in several of the BR1 and in the adjacent BR2.

Neurones projecting to the BR1 were prominent in the BR2.

Hardly any BR1 neurones projecting to the BR2 were concomitantly Fos-positive.

A considerably larger  proportion of BR1 neurones projecting to the BR2 were c-Fos-immunopositive.

dopamine beta-hydroxylase staining was confined to sparse networks of weakly fluorescent fibers with the highest numbers in the internal plexiform layer of the BR1 and fewer fibers in the external plexiform, rostral, and granular layers of the BR2 .

The BR1 receiving baroreceptor and chemoreceptor afferents--BR2 --showed scattered substance P immunoreactive nerve terminals.

An important result of these experiments was the observation that regions of the BR1 adjacent to the BR2 , i.e.

Cells in the BR1 were intracellularly labeled in BR2 tissue slices of two bat and two rodent species.

The main cell type found in this nucleus, the principal cell, is an important link in the relay of ascending projections from the BR1 to the BR2, completing an essential pathway for sound localization.

Although the dendrites of most labeled cells were confined to the BR1, some principal cells had dendrites that spread outside the nucleus to one of several adjacent BR2 cell groups.

The BR1 does not project directly to the motoneurons innervating the muscles involved in mating, but is thought to make use of the BR2  as relay.

The BR1 is located ventrolaterally in the most BR2, and projects directly to iliopsoas and cutaneus trunci motoneuronal cell groups.

These results correspond with the hypothesis that in hamster the BR1 - BR2 -motoneuronal projection not only involves motoneurons of iliopsoas and cutaneus trunci but also of lateral longissimus and quadratus lumborum .

galanin-immunoreactive fibers were present in neurohypophyseal digitations of both the BR1 with highest density in the region of the BR2, where growth hormone and gonadotropic cells are located.

On the ipsilateral side, these cells were located in the BR1 and, less often, in the BR2.

On the contralateral side, most labelled ganglion cells were visible in the BR1 but a few could also be seen in the BR2.

were made in different folia of the BR1 of cats, and the sites of occurrence of labeled cells in the BR2 were precisely determined.

The labeled cells are found within three only of the four BR1 previously determined  to project onto the BR2 (fig.

The phenomenon that following microinjections of horseradish peroxidase in superficial parts of the folia labeled cells occur within parts only of the regions of the BR1 which contain labeled cells following large horseradish peroxidase -injections in the BR2 is discussed.

Mormyrid fish showed the strongest immunoreactivity in the knollenorgan electroreceptor pathway; in the BR1  and the big cells of the BR2.

In the electromotor system, two nuclei in the corollary discharge pathway showed labeling: in the BR1 and the BR2.

The electromotor system showed labeling in the BR1 and less strongly in the BR2, but none in the pacemaker.

A discrete preganglionic cell column (BR1, CT) in the BR2 is first discernible in a avian embryos on day 8 when it contains approximately 9,300 visceral motoneurons.

Daily injections of nerve growth factor   on the chorioallantoic membrane from day 3 to day 9 produced a dose-dependent increase in both the volume of the BR1 sympathetic ganglia and the number of motoneurons in the corresponding BR2 on day 10.

Nerve growth factor decreased the number of pyknotic  neurons in both the BR1 sympathetic ganglia and the corresponding BR2 on days 8 and 10.

The increased number of neurons in both the BR1 sympathetic ganglia and the corresponding BR2 following chronic administration of nerve growth factor is the result of decreased cell death.

Daily injections of nerve growth factor  from day 10 until day 14 increased the volume of  the BR1 sympathetic ganglia on day 15 but no effect on the number of motoneurons in the corresponding BR2.

In the toadfish BR1, glutamatergic hair cells are present throughout the BR2.

The first pathway arises from neurons which send axons to the contralateral medial longitudinal fasciculus ; BR1 neurons show excitatory postsynaptic potentials  after stimulation of the BR2 .

No BR1 neurons with axon collaterals in the BR2 are present in the data of this study.

Most BR1 neurons have large ellipsoid-polygonal somata ( Most BR2 neurons have smaller ellipsoid-polygonal somata , 60.2 microns), thick axons , mostly non-spiny dendrites and dendritic fields that are only slightly flattened in the anteroposterior direction.

About half of BR1 neurons have bifurcated axon collaterals with both anterior and posterior projections, and in these neurons antidromic spike potentials are elicited by stimulation of the BR2.

connexin family of proteins 26 is also expressed in the CNS, primarily in the BR1, but is also reported in astrocytes and in neurons of developing brain and BR2.

By confocal microscopy, connexin family of proteins 26 was colocalized with both connexin family of proteins 30 and connexin family of proteins 43 in leptomeninges as well as along blood vessels in BR1 and BR2.

The trunk of the BR1 divides into dorsal and ventral roots as it enters the BR2.

A portion of the ascending fibers continue more rostrally and terminate in the BR1 and bilaterally in the BR2.

The ventral part of the peptide-positive area overlaps with the BR1 of the BR2 in which the TH-positive dendrites extend.

Adult neurogenesis was also detected in the BR1 but not in the BR2.

Ontogeny of somatostatin immunoreactive neurons in the BR1 and other BR2 of the lizard Podarcis hispanica.

The first somatostatin immunoreactive somata in the lizard BR1 appeared on E36, and they were located in non BR2.

Then, on E39 and later, somatostatin immunoreactive neurons were seen in the lizard BR1 in a rostral-to-caudal spatial gradient, which parallels that of the normal histogenesis of the lizard BR2.

On E39, labelled somata were seen in the BR1 inner plexiform layers; immunoreactive puncta and dendritic processes were detectable in the inner plexiform layer of the BR2.

On P28, groups of labelled neurons appeared in the cell layer of BR1, reaching the adult-mature pattern of somatostatin immunoreactivity in the lizard BR2, i.e.

Immunoreactive somata and processes occupied all the BR1, but they were especially abundant in the BR2.

The most conspicuous finding regarding the location of slowly adapting lung stretch terminals is that they are concentrated within specific BR1  and are distributed widely in the rostrocaudal plane of the BR2.

The BR1  in the North American opossum is located, for the most part, adjacent to the motor root of the BR2.

Although there is some topography to such projections, it is not sharply defined and many regions of the BR1 contain labelled neurons after injections of horseradish peroxidase into widely separate areas of the BR2.

Because of its embryogenesis and position, the BR1 is often considered part of the BR2.

Donor BR1 were obtained from normal Long-Evans fetuses and transplanted to the BR2 of Brattleboro rats.

Although BR1 were identified in grafts recovered from each intraventricular transplantation site, an appreciable input to the host brain could be identified only when the fetal tissue was grafted to the BR2.

An atlas of transverse sections of the BR1 and BR2 was established in macaque with reference to ventricular coordinates.

Both a personal case studied with autoradiography and data from literature were used to analyze the distribution of BR1 axons into the BR2.

Each BR1 dendritic disc is able to receive axons from a wide region of the BR2.

Substance P-positive cells and processes were found in the BR1 and in the BR2.

The area containing BR1 terminal fibers and the area occupied by BR2 -IO neurons has been found to match.

Intracerebroventricular infusions of nerve growth factor into the BR1 adjacent to the BR2 resulted in a 58% increase in relative cellular levels of trkA mRNA in the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca .

These data provide evidence that both p75 nerve growth factor R and trkA are expressed by nerve growth factor -responsive neurons in the BR1 and BR2 .

Patchy intrinsic projections in BR1, BR2, of the cat: morphological and immunocytochemical evidence for an excitatory function.

The focal regions of activity occurred in pairs involving both medial and lateral representations in the BR1, perhaps reflecting the paired medial and lateral projections of BR2 sensory neurons expressing specific types of odorant feature receptor proteins.

Serial section electron microscopy has been used to examine a horseradish peroxidase -labelled group Ia afferent collateral from its entry point in the grey matter to its termination in BR1 of the cat BR2.

BR1 projections to the major respiratory neuron populations in the BR2 of the cat.

The results suggest that the BR1 form an extensively interconnected neuronal system receiving convergent inputs from the same BR2, consistent with the hypothesis that the dorsal and ventral groups are primarily sites for integration of sensory and premotor respiratory drive inputs.

Understanding the interaction of the BR1 and BR2 requires knowledge of the highly complex spatial characteristics of cerebro-cerebellar signal transfer.

This non-overlapping distribution is consistent with a compartmentalized organization of the BR1 projection and may be the basis of the fractured type of maps found in the BR2 granular layer.

This matches the diameter of dendritic trees of layer 5 projection neurons, indicating that non-overlapping populations of BR1 projection neurons possess non-overlapping patches of BR2 terminals.

Because the calbindin-rich and -poor regions of P corresponded to differential patterns of BR1 connectivity, the results suggest that calbindin may further delineate functional subdivisions in the BR2.

Caudally, the nucleus consists of a small number of loosely aggregated neurons lying lateral to the BR1 at a rostrocaudal level corresponding to the rostral one-fifth of the somatic cell columns of the BR2.

Rostrally, the BR1 increases in size and reaches its maximum development in its rostral half, where it lies ventrolateral to the BR2 .

Injections of horseradish peroxidase into lesions at BR1 resulted in retrograde labelling of neurons of all sizes and shapes throughout the entire length of the BR2 .

However, the greatest number of horseradish peroxidase -labelled cells in BR1 were observed subsequent to injections of the enzyme into BR2.

Following injections of horseradish peroxidase into the BR1 only small to medium-sized neurons were labelled in the nucleus, the majority of which are located in BR2 .

The sizes of the projections from these two nuclei to the BR1 appeared to be much larger than that from the BR2 .

Smaller numbers of neurons were also observed in the BR1  and BR2 .

The BR1 has predominantly ascending projections to the BR2.

The BR1 also projects topographically to layers 4 and 8-13 of the BR2.

In the 2-deoxyglucose experiments, bats presented with second harmonic frequency modulated stimuli alone showed uptake of label in specific regions of the BR1, and the BR2.

We combined immunoperoxidase labeling of the anterograde tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin  with immunogold-silver labeling of tyrosine hydroxylase to determine whether this enzymatic marker for catecholamines was present in efferents from the BR1 or their targets in the rat BR2 .

At survival periods of 10-12 days after Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin injections into the BR1, light microscopy revealed numerous varicose processes containing peroxidase reaction product for Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin in the BR2 .

We conclude that a few catecholamine, but mainly noncatecholamine efferents from the BR1 provide a monosynaptic, and most likely inhibitory input to target neurons both with and without tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the BR2 .

Synapses between the efferent terminals from the BR1 and tyrosine hydroxylase labeled and unlabeled dendrites as well as unlabeled axons in these specific BR2 suggest multiple sites for modulation of gastric and cardiovascular reflexes in response to circulating peptides.

Confocal three-dimensional reconstructions revealed clusters of postsynaptic density s along proximal dendrites of transfected pyramidal neurons in BR1, but not in BR2.

Examination of Golgi-impregnated specimens demonstrates that the BR1 has precise boundaries primarily determined by a conical condensation of fibers of the BR2  around the nucleus.

The present study describes the efferent projections and terminal distributions within the BR1 of individual layers of the rat BR2  as studied by the methods of anterograde transport of the lectin Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin  and retrograde transport of the fluorescent dye Fast Blue .

Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin injections into layers IV, V, and VI reveal widespread efferent projections to all of the more superficially located layers of the BR1 in addition to projections to the BR2.

Taken together, the findings of the present experiments suggest that  all layers of the BR1 have longitudinal projections directed primarily toward the ventral  part of this BR2,  the projections of layers II and III are relatively restricted compared of the deeper layers.

Cells of the BR1 arise from the lateral ganglionic eminence of the BR2 neuroepithelium.

Two principal conclusions are drawn: Progenitors at the different rostrocaudal levels are heterogeneous with regard to the pattern of cellular proliferation, and ganglionic progenitors are in advance of the BR1 BR2 progenitors based on the relative size of the secondary proliferative population and the magnitude of cytokinetic parameters.

To follow on a recent quantitative study of the developing cholinergic  innervation in rat BR1, axon varicosities identified by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry with a highly sensitive antibody against choline acetyltransferase  were examined in the BR2  of rats at postnatal ages  P8, P16, and P32.

In the present study some afferent, BR1, and efferent connections of the BR2 in the turtle Pseudemys scripta elegans were demonstrated with the HRP tracing technique.

Distinct BR1 projections appeared to arise in the BR2.

The BR1 projection arising in the BR2 appeared to be only sparsely developed.

The ascending vestibulo-oculomotor projection was found to be organized in an ipsilateral pathway arising in the BR1 and in a contralateral pathway, arising mainly in the BR2.

Finally, several neurons in the lumbar enlargement were labeled retrogradely with FluoroRuby after injections into the BR1 and the immediately adjacent BR2.

At the light microscopic level, calcitonin gene-related peptide -like immunoreactive  fibers and substance P -like immunoreactive  fibers were found to pass through the lateral edge of the BR1 and then into the BR2.

In addition, substance P -I fibers also extend from the BR1 into the entire BR2.

For example, LAR mRNA is highly expressed by both proliferating and postmitotic cells in the BR1 at embryonic day 17 and in all layers of the BR2 at postnatal day 4.

To better understand the role played by SCG10 and stathmin in vivo, we have analyzed the expression and localization of these proteins in both the BR1 epithelium and the BR2 in developing and adult rats, as well as in adult bulbectomized rats.

In the BR1 of postnatal and adult rats, a moderate to strong SCG10 immunoreactivity was present in the BR2 layer, whereas no labeling was detected in the glomerular layer.

In this study we assessed synapse density within the BR1 and the BR2 of Tg2576 mice at 6-18 months of age using stereological methods at both the light and electron microscope levels.

Under light microscopy we failed to find overall decreases in the density of synaptophysin-positive boutons in any brain areas selected, but bouton density was significantly decreased within 200 mum of compact beta-amyloid plaques in the outer molecular layer of the BR1 and Layers II and III of the BR2 at 15-18 months of age in Tg 2576 mice.

Under electron microscopy, we found overall decreases in synapse density in the outer molecular layer of the BR1 at both 6-9 and 15-18 months of age, and in Layers II and III of the BR2 at 15-18 months of age in Tg 2576 mice.

These results provide the first quantitative morphological evidence at the ultrastructure level of a spatial relationship between beta-amyloid plaques and synapse loss within the BR1 and the BR2 of Tg2576 mice.

The morphology of 11 BR1  inspiratory neurons located in the BR2  was studied using the technique of intracellular labeling with the enzyme horseradish peroxidase .

The aberrant projection arises as a vertically directed branch from the contralaterally traveling BR1 axon at the BR2 .

Areal differences in the laminar distribution of BR1 afferents in BR2 of primates.

A cytoarchitectonic parcellation has been made of the BR1 and of the adjoining parts of the BR2 in rhesus and squirrel monkeys.

In the "second" and "third" sensory areas, such as the BR1 and many of the BR2, the density of the plexus and its coarseness diminish slightly and the deeper half of layer IV becomes free of terminals.

in BR1 and BR2) there is labeling of the superficial half of layer VI.

Where layers V and VI become subdivided in the homotypical BR1, the auditory and adjacent fields were only observed in cases in which the BR2 was involved by the injection of isotope.

The boundaries of the BR1 projection fields of individual BR2, as determined autoradiographically, are remarkably sharp and invariably coincide with a sharp architectonic boundary or with a zone of maximal cytoarchitectonic change.

As early as stage 33, nitrergic cells were observed in the BR1 within the developing BR2.

BR1 was dissected from fetal rats and transplanted adjacent to the BR2 of newborn rats.

The projection from host BR1 (particularly from BR2) was the densest and most consistent projection.

Dormant basket cell" hypothesis revisited: relative vulnerabilities of BR1 mossy cells and inhibitory interneurons after BR2 status epilepticus in the rat.

BR1 connections of the BR2 in the rhesus monkey.

The BR1 connections of different architectonic areas of the BR2  in the rhesus monkey were investigated with the aid of both anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques.

The BR1 projects to, and receives fibers from, BR2, viz.

BR1 projection fibers in the monkey BR2: a demonstration of the fiber pathways by retrograde axonal transport of WGA-HRP.

On the other hand, the scatter of fibers from the BR1 and BR2 progressed gradually through the nerve.

However, the BR1 fibers were located in the lateral periphery of the nerve, and they overlapped significantly with fibers from the BR2.

Thus, the present findings based on more precise anatomical techniques indicate that the classical notion of the BR1 quadrant topography in the monkey BR2 probably is suspect.

Mean total cell labeling was less than 400 per BR1, suggesting recruitment from a very small fraction of the neurons contained within the BR2 .

The mitral cell of the BR1 is the primary relay neuron that transmits information from the BR2 receptors to the rest of the brain.

In vitro BR1 neurons and their dendrites from embryonic day  18 BR2 responded to t-ACPD and quisqualate, selective and nonselective metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists, and to several ionotropic glutamate agonists with increases in intracellular Ca2+ as studied with fura-2 digital imaging.

The BR1 displays the most intense expression of parvalbumin within the BR2.

We compare the distribution of calcium-binding proteins in the diencephalon of Psammodromus with other vertebrates, with mammals in particular, and suggest that the middle and ventral tiers of the reptilian BR1 may be comparable to nonspecific or plurimodal BR2 in mammals, on the basis of the calcium-binding protein expression patterns, as well as the hodological and embryological data in the literature.

Post-rolandic BR1 projections of the BR2 in the rhesus monkey.

The efferent connections of different cytoarchitectonic areas of the BR1  in the rhesus monkey with BR2 were investigated using autoradiographic methods.

BR1, in addition, were identified according to their cells of origin and the laterality of their BR2 projections after injection of tracer.

Faint projections were demonstrated to the BR1 and the BR2.

Unlike the sensorimotor apparatus controlling limb and body movements, the BR1 controlling the head and neck received prominent BR2 projections.

There is a correlation between axon number and mitral/tufted cell number during larval development that is consistent with the hypothesis that BR1 axons influence BR2 development.

Changes in tactile stimuli-induced behavior and c-Fos expression in the BR1 and in BR2 after sciatic nerve crush.

We have now investigated whether a sciatic nerve crush injury alters the behavioral response in rats to tactile stimuli and whether this is associated with a change in the pattern of c-Fos expression in the BR1 and the BR2.

C-Fos expression in the BR1 and BR2 was never observed on brushing the skin of the sciatic nerve territory in animals with intact nerves, but was found after sciatic nerve crush with peripheral regeneration.

We conclude that after nerve injury, low threshold mechanoreceptor fibers may play a major role in producing pain-related behavior by activating normally nociceptive-specific regions of the central nervous system such as the superficial laminae of the BR1 and the BR2.

Evidence for segregated corticocortical networks linking BR1 with the BR2.

We have examined the circuitry connecting the BR1 with the BR2 of rhesus monkeys.

HRP-WGA and tritiated amino acids were injected into BR1, and anterograde and retrograde label was recorded within the BR2.

Our main finding is that each BR1 is connected with a unique set of BR2.

Here we show that relatively mature neurons generated from neurospheres derived from postnatal BR1 or BR2 undergo a phenotypic transformation into astrocytes that coincides with the appearance of a nonfused, hybrid cell type that shares the morphology, antigenicity, and physiology of both neurons and astrocytes.

Distribution of BR1 projections from BR2 lamina I neurons in the cat and the monkey.

The distribution of terminal projections in the BR1 from lamina I neurons in the BR2 was investigated with the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin in the cat and the cynomolgus monkey.

These observations indicate that BR1 lamina I neurons project to a variety of BR2 involved in autonomic  and homeostatic processing and the control of behavioral state.

The genetically determined loss of BR1 Purkinje cells  in "Purkinje cell degeneration"  mutant mice deprives BR2  neurons of their major postsynaptic target.

The BR1  appeared less affected than the BR2 .

Motoneurons innervating the palatoglossus are located in the BR1 and, possibly, in BR2.

Long-term survival of centrally projecting axons in the BR1 of the frog following destruction of the BR2.

At the end of various survival periods following unilateral removal of the BR1, horseradish peroxidase  was administered to the BR2 stump by a fiber-filling method.

However, approximately 55,000 normal-appearing unmyelinated axons  persisted in the BR1 at 10 weeks following removal of the BR2.

It is hypothesized that the potential shown by frog BR1 axons for long-term survival in the absence of the cell-body expresses a general property of vertebrate  axons, rather than a special property of the frog BR2.

Development of the rat BR1: I. Mosaic organization of the BR2 neuroepithelium.

Short-survival, sequential, and long-survival thymidine radiograms of rat embryos, fetuses and young pups were analyzed in order to delineate the boundaries of the proliferative BR1 neuroepithelium, describe its early transformations, identify its regional divisions, and, finally, attempt to relate its distinct neuroepithelial components to specific BR2 that they supply with neurons.

In this introductory paper, some evidence is presented in support of the hypothesis that the identified BR1 represent putative cell lines committed to produce neurons for specific, early-generated BR2.

The early derivatives of the BR1 and BR2.

The early derivatives of the BR1 are the BR2.

Thus these data indicate a previously unrecognized topographic representation of the vertical dimension of the BR1 across BR2 isofrequency laminae.

BR1 afferents to the rat BR2: synaptic targets and relation to dopamine terminals.

In the present study, we investigated the ultrastructure and synaptic targets of BR1 terminals, as well as their relation to dopamine terminals within the BR2 of adult rats.

BR1 afferents were labeled either by anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase  from the BR2 or by anterograde degeneration following fimbria lesion.

BR1 terminals in the BR2 , identified by either method, formed primarily asymmetric axospinous synapses, with a small percentage forming asymmetric axodendritic synapses.

Thus, the contralateral  BR1 showed a decrease, whereas the BR2 showed an increase in the synapse-to-neuron ratio compared with light-reared, nonenucleated rats.

When enucleated rats were reared in the raised in either "light" or "dark" , there was a decrease in the ratio in both BR1, although the extent of this decrease was more marked in the contralateral than the BR2.

The maturation of the BR1 projections to the BR2 of the golden hamster has been traced by using the Fink-Heimer silver technique to stain degenerating axons and terminal arborizations after bulbectomy at different ages between birth and 33 days.

By five days of age the caudal region exhibiting a long-lasting degeneration reaction extends from the middle of the BR1 to the middle of the BR2.

Examination of thick serial sections and surface preparations with the differential interference contrast microscope  allowed direct visualization of individually impregnated BR1 cells, complete with their peripheral processes and endings in the BR2.

There are at least two types of BR1 cells in the BR2 of the infant cat and rat.

Hence, these ganglion cells establish nearly "point-to-point" connections between the BR1 and the BR2.

The vagal potential underwent a phase reversal in the middle layers; thus, the current sink site was cytoarchitectonically identified as the BR1 or the BR2, where no somatosensory input has previously been demonstrated.

Double-labeling experiments show that the projections of the subesophageal-calycal tract neurons do not overlap with the projections of the BR1 projection neurons and visual projection neurons from the BR2.

Glycine-immunoreactive projection of the cat BR1: possible role in BR2 ear dominance.

Neurons in the BR1 are optimally excited by stimulation of the ipsilateral ear, as are those in the BR2 by stimulation of the contralateral ear.

Thus, there is a heavy uncrossed projection from the cat BR1 to the BR2 that may be glycinergic and inhibitory.

Positive fibers were also seen in the BR1 and in the BR2.

The axons of the primary sensory BR1 neurons project from the BR2 lining the nasal cavity, onto glomeruli covering the surface of the olfactory bulb.

The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that phenotypically unique subsets of primary sensory BR1 neurons, scattered throughout the nasal cavity, project to a subset of glomeruli in specific BR2 loci.

These data demonstrated that a phenotypically distinct subset of primary sensory olfactory neurons exhibits a topographical projection from the BR1 to the BR2, and suggests that these, and other subsets, may form the basis of the mosaic nature of this pathway.

Moreover, it appears that the outer nerve fibre layer in the BR1 plays an important instructive role in the guidance and fasciculation of BR2 sensory axons.

In monkeys monocularly treated with tetrodotoxin for 1 day to 2 weeks, both Nuclear respiratory factor 2 alpha expression and c oxidase activity were reduced in deprived BR1 and in deprived layers of the BR2.

basic fibroblast growth factor stimulated DNA synthesis by 68% in BR1, and by &gt; 250% in BR2 .

In contrast, incorporation was not altered in BR1 or BR2, regions in which neurogenesis has already ceased.

These results suggest that the specific BR1 pathway sets up an excitatory synaptic activity in the BR2 of the irradiated animal.

In contrast to the strong innervation of BR1 and BR2 in mammal, the melanin-concentrating hormone and hypocretin systems in goldfish barely innervate these aminergic populations related to the regulation of sleep and arousal.

melanin-concentrating hormone , but not hypocretin, immunoreactive fibers terminate substantially in the sensory layer of the BR1 of goldfish, while both peptidergic systems distribute to the BR2.

In the BR1 , Noradrenaline-immunoreactive BR2 -contacting neurons are located in the same regions where dopamine- and serotonin-containing cerebrospinal fluid contacting neurons occur.

Interestingly, Noradrenaline-immunoreactive fibers form large club endings in some subdivisions of the BR1, and parallel fibers in the BR2 granular layer.

Comparison with the distribution of Noradrenaline-immunoreactive or dopamine-beta-hydroxylase-immunoreactivity in other species shows that all teleosts studied to date have noradrenergic cells in the BR1 and the BR2.

However, Noradrenaline-immunoreactive BR1 -contacting BR2 cells have been described only in the teleost Gnathonemus petersii and the lizard Gekko gecko (Smeets and Steinbusch: J. Comp.

It is possible that they might pick up catecholamines as well as serotonin from the BR1 , into which monoamines might be released by BR2 axonal plexuses.

Compared with workers, they all have large eyes, relatively larger BR1, smaller BR2, and similarly sized antennal lobes.

The input regions of the BR1, the lip and the collar, generally correlate with the size of the BR2, respectively.

For instance, the BR1 and BR2  mostly contained thick axons that contributed clusters of large-sized varicosities, each forming multiple asymmetric synapses, usually with vesicle-filled dendrites.

Because the BR1 does not project to the BR2, this labeling had to arise from a neuronal population with branching axons to both structures.

Previous findings pointed to three possible sources: BR1 monoaminergic cells, intralaminar BR2 neurons, and corticostriatal cells.

Therefore, we concluded that the BR1 anterograde labeling originated from corticostriatal neurons, with axons branching to the BR2.

A systematic representation of the contralateral body surface was found in BR1 adjoining the first somatosensory representation, BR2 .

The representation of the body in BR1 was found to be much less distorted than in BR2.

This orientation allows BR1 and BR2 to be adjoined along a common border representing the top of the head and face.

After iontophoretic deposits of biotinylated dextran amine  in the area of the BR1 , many biotinylated dextran amine -labeled terminals in the BR2  were immunoreactive for enkephalin and vesicular glutamate transporter-2 .

Thus, we have studied the membrane availability and intraneuronal distribution of the m2 muscarinic autoreceptor  in cholinergic neurons of the BR1  projecting to the BR2 .

The cerebello-pulvinar fibers were found to arise mainly from the BR1 and to terminate contralaterally in a narrow area at the extreme BR2 at the level of the stereotaxic frontal plane A-7.0.

The area of terminal ramification of retino-pulvinar fibers was seen as a thin sheet lying at the extreme BR1 through most of the BR2 , bilaterally with contralateral predominance.

The BR1 did not seem to overlap with the BR2 area; the former appeared to be contiguous ventrolaterally to the latter.

Collectively, these findings indicate that glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the zebrafish BR1 and that ionotropic glutamate receptor subtypes function heterogeneously in the BR2 neurons.

Pyramidal neurons in the mouse BR1 were labeled by the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase  injected into the BR2.

To avoid confusion, terminals in BR1 labeled by the anterograde transport of horseradish peroxidase injected into BR2 were eliminated by lesion-induced degeneration.

Although the descending projections were bilateral with an ipsilateral dominance, BR1 received a more dominant ipsilateral projection than BR2 .

The BR1, which is located in the BR2, supplies the musculi recti inferior and medialis and the musculus obliquus inferior without a clear somatotopic representation of the motoneurons.

The BR1, which rostrally joins the BR2 with a gap of only about 40 micron between the nuclei, is situated completely contralateral to the musculus obliquus superior supplied by it.

Dendrites of the BR1 and of the BR2 extend into neuropil areas receiving primary sensory afferents.

Axotomy induces a different modulation of both low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor and choline acetyltransferase between adult rat BR1 and BR2 motoneurons.

Adult rat BR1 and BR2 motoneurons re-express low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor  after their axotomy.

Results of these previous studies differed regarding the type of the most effective triggering injury for p75 reexpression, the relative duration of this reexpression and the decrease of choline acetyltransferase  immunoreactivity  following a permanent axotomy of BR1 or BR2 motoneurons.

This evidence indicates that BR1 and BR2 motoneurons respond to a permanent axotomy with a different modulation of p75 and choline acetyltransferase expression.

In colchicine-treated turtles and pigeons, numerous calcitonin-gene-related peptide + perikarya were observed in the BR1 of the BR2 (n.

Injections of fluorogold into the BR1 combined with immunofluorescence labeling for calcitonin-gene-related peptide revealed that calcitonin-gene-related peptide + cells in these areas do, in fact, project to the BR2.

These include the possibility that BR1 projections to the BR2 arose independently in the lines of evolution leading to mammals and sauropsids.

Dual immunostaining for Fluoro-Gold  and ER alpha or Fluoro-Gold and androgen receptors showed that over one-third of BR1 efferents to the BR2 contain receptors for either estrogen or androgen.

In addition, approximately 50% of BR1 neurons retrogradely labeled from the BR2 were immunoreactive for either ER alpha or androgen receptors .

The BR1 projection of the BR2 in the rat: a retrograde fluorescent dye study.

The fluorescent dye, retrograde labeling technique was used to determine the extent of the projection from the BR1 to the BR2 in the rat.

An analysis of the results demonstrates that the projection to the BR1 arises in the medial neurons within the BR2.

This projection is directed to the BR1, but not to the BR2.

The BR1 receives a BR2 projection which originates from neurons in two areas,  the medial part of the anterior one-third of the nucleus and  the center  portion of the posterior two-thirds of the nucleus.

These results demonstrate that the BR1 gives rise to a rather widespread and topographically organized projection to the BR2 of the rat.

Some of the fine fibers in the BR1 appeared to be collaterals of thicker fibers that terminated in the BR2 .

The labeling was more sparse than that observed in the BR1 after larger BR2 injections but displayed the same morphological characteristics.

The Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin observations were corroborated by the presence of many retrogradely labeled lamina I cells at both BR1, following injections of cholera toxin subunit b or rhodamine-labeled microspheres in the BR2 .

These observations indicate that the BR1 receives input from lamina I neurons, and probably from lamina III-V neurons as well, at BR2.

The lamina I input could also be responsible for the general inhibition of lateral BR1 neurons by wide-field noxious stimulation, via activation of GABAergic interneurons in the BR2 .

This study examined the morphology of individual BR1 terminals that were filled with horseradish peroxidase by injections in the optic tract or BR2.

These immunoreactive cells move outside the BR1 to form the ganglion of the BR2.

BR1-projecting vasopressinergic neurons in the rat BR2.

This may be exerted by neurons in the BR1 with BR2 projections.

In this study, we have analyzed the distribution of BR1-projecting BR2 neurons that express vasopressin, an important neuropeptide in autonomic regulation.

More than 40% of the BR1 projecting neurons in the BR2 of naive Sprague-Dawley rats were found to express vasopressin mRNA.

The BR1 displayed large numbers of vasopressin mRNA-expressing neurons, but very few of those projected to the BR2.

The BR1 contained a large number of BR2 projecting neurons, but very few of those expressed vasopressin mRNA.

This provides an anatomical basis for a selective activation of functionally different groups in the BR1 as part of a behaviorally adaptive response, including modulation of autonomic activity and pain processing at the BR2 level.

Brain sections cut parallel to the BR1 revealed myelin-light septa that isolated representations of the digits and parts of the face, teeth, and tongue in BR2 of adult and infant macaque monkeys.

A reticular pattern of intrinsic connections in primate BR1 (BR2).

A system of periodic intrinsic connections is demonstrated in BR1 (BR2) of squirrel and macaque monkeys by large injections of tritiated amino acids, horseradish peroxidase , and fluorescent latex beads.

As in BR1, the tangential configuration of these connections in BR2 is reticular or latticelike, and is detectable for 2.5-3.0 mm from an injection site of horseradish peroxidase , 3H amino acids, or latex beads.

Other extrinsic connections, however, such as backgoing connections from BR1 to BR2, do not seem to have a periodic distribution.

Organization of visual corticostriatal projections in the cat, with observations on visual projections to BR1 and BR2.

Retrograde tracer deposits into the visual recipient zone of the BR1 reveal substantial convergence of other BR2 inputs to this same domain.

Aspects of visuotopic organization are preserved in the visual projections to both the BR1 and the BR2, but unequivocal retinotopic organization could not be inferred from the available material.

Ten of the eleven BR1 also project topographically onto the visual zone of the BR2.

BR1 afferents to the BR2 in the cat: a horseradish peroxidase study.

Omnipause" neurons , located in the BR1 and the BR2, actively suppress saccadic eye movements during intersaccadic intervals.

To determine the BR1 afferents that may inhibit the OPNs and thereby allow a saccade to occur, we injected horseradish peroxidase into the BR2 of four cats at the site of physiologically identified OPNs.

A few neurons were labeled in a restricted region of the causal part of the BR1 and in the BR2.

Larger numbers of neurons were labeled in the BR1 and in parts of the BR2.

The best prospects for a saccade initiation signal from one of the labeled populations appear to be the BR1 and/or the BR2.

In the present study, we investigated the expression profiles and activity levels of ligands and receptors of the Transforming growth factor-beta and bone morphogenetic protein 4 family during the physiological programmed cell death periods of the developing chick and mouse BR1 and possible interactions of both proapoptotic molecules in mediating apoptosis in chick and murine BR2 whole-mount cultures.

Retrograde transganglionic transport of HRP revealed somatotopy within the BR1e: the delicate nerve fibres innervating the chemosensory anterior dorsal fin terminate exclusively in a distinct, dorsal portion of the BR2.

Antisera to GAD  and GABA were used to determine the distribution of GABAergic cells and terminals in the BR1 and midbrain BR2 of the barn owl.

In the time pathway, all the cells of the BR1 and BR2 receive perisomatic GABAergic terminals, and small numbers of GABAergic neurons surround both nuclei.

BR1 epilepsy is often associated with pathological changes in the BR2, and such changes may be more common in humans than in some nonprimate species.

These noradrenergic projection neurons were located not only in the BR1  but also in the BR2, including the A5  and A7  cell groups.

We examined the morphology and distribution of retrogradely labeled spinothalamic tract  neurons in lamina I  of the BR1 after large injections of cholera toxin subunit B  or Fast Blue  into the BR2 of cats.

Degeneration experiments reveal that the BR1 of the adult opossum distributes to an extensive and diverse area of the BR2 and, as in placental mammals, the traditionally named nuclei do not receive a uniform distribution of primary afferent fibers.

Regeneration of BR1 axons into the goldfish BR2.

The growth of regenerating BR1 axons into the central portion of the BR2 of adult goldfish was examined with the light and electron microscopes.

Regenerating axons appear in very large numbers and travel in fascicles in the BR1  and in the adjacent neuropil, the BR2 .

Accessory optic system of an anthropoid primate, the gibbon : evidence of a direct BR1 input to the BR2.

The course of the accessory optic tract  and the BR1 projection to the BR2 are described in the gibbon and compared to that of other mammals.

In contrast to previous reports in haplorhine primates, which describe the accessory optic system as consisting of only the BR1, we find that in the gibbon, three cellular groups receive a bilateral projection, predominantly from the BR2.

According to cytoarchitecture and topographic location, two of these nuclei correspond to the BR1 and the BR2.

There was no evidence for a ventral division of the BR1 , which in nonprimates is typically situated at the BR2.

Examination of brain morphology in primates suggests that the BR1 has been displaced from its phylogenetically stable location in the BR2 to a more dorsal position.

BR1 projects upon a belt of neurons within the overlying BR2.

BR1 projects, in turn, upon a region of BR2 containing cell bodies of the occipito-mesencephalic tract.

Organization and morphologies of acetylcholinesterase-containing neurons in the BR1 and BR2 of the rat.

The distribution and morphologies of neurons containing acetyl cholinesterase  in the BR1 and BR2 of the rat were studied by means of a pharmaco-histochemical technique involving staining for acetyl cholinesterase  at various times after administration of bis-phosphorofluoridate.

The strongest acetyl cholinesterase activity occurring at the level of the BR1 is found within the small, round to oval, somata of BR2.

Most of the BR1, as well as BR2, are composed of medium-sized multipolar neurons displaying moderate to strong acetyl cholinesterase activity.

Moderately stained acetyl cholinesterase neurons are also found in BR1 and in BR2.

At the level of the BR1, the neurons of BR2 show strong acetyl cholinesterase activity.

The acetyl cholinesterase neurons of BR1 are surrounded by numerous acetyl cholinesterase -containing processes of some large BR2 neurons that stain intensely for the enzyme.

Retrograde tracing, with either horse-radish peroxidase or rhodamine-labelled microspheres, indicated a significant increase in the number of neurons projecting to the BR1 from the BR2 of lesioned animals.

The increase was largely confined to the rostral extent of the BR1, and overlapped the distribution of cells labelled after injections of HRP into BR2 of control and lesioned animals.

These findings demonstrate that removal of dopamine afferents during development leads to an enlargement of the serotoninergic projection from the BR1 to the BR2.

Surrounding these fields is a belt of BR1 in which units are generally less responsive to acoustic stimulation and the frequency organization is more complex than in AI or R. Electrophysiological and cytoarchitectonic evidence suggest that this belt is composed of at least three and possibly four separate BR2.

Specifically, trkB and neurotrophin-3 mRNA elevations were restricted to granule cells in the BR1, whereas bilateral increases in trkC, brain-derived neurotrophic factor , and nerve growth factor  mRNA levels occurred in granule cells and BR2 pyramidal cells.

Golgi-impregnated, linearized BR1 were sectioned serially in one of the three BR2 planes.

Three days after treatment, a significant dose-dependent increase in Hsp27-immunoreactive protoplasmic astrocytes was found in the BR1, and in the BR2.

BR1 and BR2.

The largest portion of the BR1 is located dorsal to the BR2.

We have now identified a novel third population of olfactory marker protein-expressing sensory neurons that is located in a discrete pocket of the BR1, which we refer to as the BR2 .

Despite their unusual location, axons projecting from the BR1 neurons fasciculate into several discrete bundles and terminate in a subset of BR2 glomeruli.

The connections of the BR1 with BR2 neurons of the oculomotor and collimotor systems in the pigeon were delineated in experiments using WGA-HRP as an anterograde and retrograde tracer.

The retrograde data indicate that ipsilateral projections upon BR1 neurons arise from the BR2.

Projections upon BR1 neurons arise primarily from neurons in the BR2.

With the exception of BR1, BR2 projecting to neck motoneurons also project to extraocular motoneurons.

Exposure to 3H-TdR given at E36 labels a few neurons in the deepest layers of the BR1, and 3H-TdR given at E38 labels a small number of neurons in all BR2.

Postmitotic neurons migrate from a zone near the BR1 to the BR2.

The number of glial fibrillary acidic protein -positive cells in the BR1 increased steadily with time so that, by P26, glial fibrillary acidic protein -immunoreactive astrocytes were distributed evenly through all BR2 laminae.

The distribution of the BR1 efferents to the BR2 is unique in the flatfish.

In the BR1, two bands of degeneration remained over the BR2 .

Distinct layer was lacking in the BR1 with a conspicuously absent large cell layer in the BR2 .

Postnatal changes in the number of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia in the BR1 (BR2) of the macaque monkey: a stereological analysis in normal and monocularly deprived animals.

Using measurements oBR1 thickness and surface area, the total number of cells in the BR2 of one hemisphere was derived for each glial cell type.

These changes, however, were only a response to a substantial overshoot in BR1 volume at six months: the total number of astrocytes in the BR2 did not change.

Olfactory sensory neuron  axonal extension and targeting occur within the BR1 layer  of the BR2 .

The data demonstrate that, as Olfactory sensory neuron axons begin to exit the BR1 layer o and target a specific region of the BR2 , there is a down-regulation of cytoskeletal elements and bound extracellular adhesion molecules.

These BR1 units change progressively in cytoarchitecture from the lateral to the BR2.

The first two unit types display prominently two additional components of the feline BR1 -namely, clusters of dwarf cells and small pyramidal-like neurons constituting the densocellular layer cupping the base of BR2.

In the BR1 , satellite neurons are most conspicuous in granule-cell-poor spaces within the BR2, where many non-granular neurons are uncharacteristically small and chromophobic.

The BR1 itself is unusual not only for its large size but for lateral extensions encircling a group of BR2 neurons far caudally.

Such extensions are one of several indications that the BR1 is intimately associated with the BR2.

Hair cell regeneration is well documented in the BR1 sensory epithelia of lower vertebrates and birds and may occur in the BR2 of mammals.

The somatotopic organization of primary afferent terminals in the superficial laminae of the BR1 of the rat BR2.

The subdivisions of the sciatic nerve, the sural, lateral sural, superficial peroneal, and tibial nerves each projected to a separate and distinct region of the BR1 and collectively formed a "U"-shaped zone of terminal labeling extending from BR2 L2 to the caudal portions of L5.

In the larval and adult BR1, both melanopsins are expressed in a subset of cells in the BR2, resembling amacrine and ganglion cells.

The Golgi impregnated neurons in BR1 are typical of other BR2 and are not qualitatively different in the two subdivisions.

The distributions of orphanin FQ  and its cognate receptor, opioid receptor-like receptor-1 , overlap steroid-responsive regions throughout reproductive circuits of the BR1 and BR2.

We studied estrogen and progesterone regulation of OFQ/N and NOP mRNA expression in BR1-BR2 reproductive circuits.

In the BR1, estrogen increased OFQ/N mRNA levels, and progesterone did not alter this increase, whereas, in the BR2, estrogen and progesterone were needed to increase OFQ/N mRNA levels.

Steroid regulation of OFQ/N and NOP in the BR1 and BR2 is consistent with emerging data indicating that this opioid system regulates female reproduction.

In the BR1 all parts of the BR2 were found to contain catecholamines.

In the BR1 was the most heavily innervated area, followed by the BR2, which contains the majority of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons innervating the pelvic organs.

Following a crush lesion of the BR1, there was no cell loss in BR2 of normal  adult mice, but 40% cell loss occurred in Ola mice and the survivors increased in size during the period when functional reinnervation was established.

Development of BR1 topography in BR2 of normal and enucleated rats.

Moreover, BR1 input specifies the topography of BR2 projections by postnatal day 6.

After restricted intracortical injections of anterogradely and retrogradely transported tracers we observed that the normal, nonmirror-symmetric BR1 map, as well as the anomalous, mirror-symmetric map observed in neonatally enucleated animals, are present by P6-7, just as collateral branches of simple architecture emerge from their parental axons and grow into superficial BR2 layers.

Our results therefore do not support the idea that BR1 input guides BR2 map formation by primarily promoting the large-scale elimination of long, nontopographic branches and arbors.

Instead, they suggest that BR1 input specifies the sites on the parental axons from which interstitial branches will grow to invade middle and upper BR2 layers, thereby ensuring that the location of invading interstitial branches is accurately related to the topographical location of the soma that gives rise to the parental axon.

The postnatal development of a population of BR1 projecting BR2 ganglion cells with large somata in hamsters aged from postnatal day  4 to adult was studied by the intracellular injection of Lucifer Yellow.

Following BR1 transection and horseradish peroxidase impregnation, BR2 afferents show a restricted, dense core of horseradish peroxidase label in the superficial portion of the nucleus with sparser horseradish peroxidase label in the surround.

BR1 afferents arborize throughout BR2 , except in the dense-core region.

Afferents from the BR1 and BR2 appear to arborize throughout the nucleus without discernible pattern.

In the rostral part of the BR1  they were confined to lamina V  and in the BR2 and in cervical segments they were confined to lamina III/IV .

The differential laminar distribution of collateral arbors of single axons along the rostrocaudal axis distinguishes the BR1 from the BR2 where functional types of mechanoreceptive afferents form continuous or interrupted sagittal columns of terminal arbors that do not shift dorsoventrally within segments.

Projections from the BR1 to the BR2 in guinea pigs.

Axonal tracing techniques were used to study the projection from the BR1 to the BR2 in guinea pigs.

Injections of Fluoro-Gold or peroxidase-labeled-WGA and HRP into the BR1 labeled multipolar cells and octopus cells bilaterally in the BR2, mainly on the contralateral side.

Injections of PHAL into the BR1 labeled two types of axons in the BR2.

Combined anterograde and retrograde transport of different fluorescent tracers was used to identify the projections of the cells in the BR1 that receive inputs from the BR2.

The BR1 was divided into several neuromeres: the BR2 became apparent first, then the portion rostral to this sulcus was subdivided into two portions by the syn-parencephalic boundary.

Region-specific activation of microglial cells in the rat BR1 following BR2 transection.

In the BR1  containing the degenerating terminals of BR2 fibers transected by fimbria-fornix transection , a heavy reaction of lectin-labeled activated microglial cells associated with high phagocytotic activity was noticed.

Unexpectedly, after a long survival time  following BR1 transection , we observed an increase in microglial GSA I-B4 labeling in the BR2 .

a strong initial reaction in the BR1 and very little microglial activation in the BR2 , was observed after immunolesioning.

Our results indicate that the microglial reaction in the BR1 following BR2 transection differs substantially from that seen in other models of axotomy.

Ultrastructural studies of hair cells and nerve terminals in the BR1, the BR2, were carried out with transmission and scanning electron microscopes.

The projections of BR1 were determined by the intra-axonal transport of 3H-proline, 3H-acetyl-wheat germ agglutinin, and horseradish peroxidase after BR2 injections.

Single injections in BR1 sometimes produced label in two separate regions in the BR2, suggesting that functional subdivisions exist in this projection zone.

A major feedback projection of BR1 was to BR2.

Axonal trajectory and terminal distribution of inspiratory neurons of the BR1 in the cat's BR2.

One branch crossed the midline to project to the BR1, and the other, thinner branch descended caudally in the BR2 without distributing any terminals.

The axon of the second type projected to the BR1 and distributed collateral branches with terminal boutons in the BR2 .

The third type projected to the BR1 and distributed terminal boutons in the BR2  and its vicinity.

The fourth type distributed numerous branches with terminal boutons in and around the BR1 and the BR2 area.

Only a small proportion of tyrosine hydroxylase-like immunoreactive neurons in the BR1, rostral linear nucleus, and BR2 contained NADPH diaphorase activity.

The other cell type was a bistratified cell with processes in both BR1 1  and BR2 .

Computer-assisted analysis confirmed the location of substance P-containing processes at 5-15% ( BR1 ) and 50-70% ( BR2 ) depth levels in the inner plexiform layer.

Whereas immunoreactivity was conspicuous in the ganglia of nervus terminalis , a weak reaction was detected in some granule cells in the BR1 and in the cells of BR2 .

In normal frontal sections of the BR1, five columns of fibers surrounded by neuronal cell bodies could be clearly distinguished, but the number is probably fortuitous, for there was no one-on-one relationship with the five BR2 ganglia.

In addition, a dense bundle of long varicose processes projecting rostrocaudally was observed coursing along the ventral surface of the brain from the BR1 to the BR2.

Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of frog brain, BR1, and BR2 extracts revealed that, in all three regions, Urotensin II -immunoreactive material eluted as a single peak which exhibited the same retention time as synthetic frog Urotensin II .

Intense or moderate expression of mGluR4 mRNA was detected in the granule cells of the BR1 and BR2, whereas no significant expression of mGluR7 mRNA was found in these cells.

Distribution of neurons projecting to the BR1 correlates with thick cytochrome oxidase stripes in macaque BR2.

We examined this idea further by comparing the pattern of cytochrome oxidase stripes with the distribution of neurons in BR1 that project to the BR2.

Visually evoked activity in the BR1 is known to be greatly reduced by blocking magnocellular but not parvocellular layers of the BR2 .

BR1 input to the BR2 in the macaque monkey: potential substrate for parkinsonian tremor.

The BR1 input was directed mostly to the BR2 and cells just caudal to it.

To verify this apparent dependence of parvalbumin expression on Purkinje cell input in the BR1 , the patterns of expression in five other BR2 mutants  with differing grades and chronologies of Purkinje cell loss were compared.

In staggerer mice, neurons immunopositive for parvalbumin as well as for Calbindin D-28k were present in BR1, likely representing ectopic Purkinje cell s rather than BR2 neurons.

The axons of two groups of Manduca sexta allatostatin -immunoreactive neurosecretory cells in the BR1 form part of the BR2 .

Ipsilateral BR1 motor neurons also appeared clustered within the BR2 and had thicker dendrites.

Double labeling experiments indicated light and electron microscopically colocalization of mGluR7a- and mGluR8-LI in axon terminals on dendritic shafts of presumed interneurons in the superficial layer of the BR1 and layer Ia of the BR2.

The results suggest that glutamate release from axon terminals of projection fibers from BR1 and BR2 is regulated presynaptically and differentially through mGluR2/3, mGluR7a, and/or mGluR8.

The BR1 also had numerous dendritic bundles extending across the midline, linking the BR2 bilaterally.

In additional experiments, the afferent projections to the BR1 were examined, providing an anatomical description of the tonotopicity of the BR2.

Deposits of horseradish peroxidase in the DPD labeled cells in each of the BR1 that have previously been shown to project to the entire BR2.

When deposits of horseradish peroxidase were made into other frequency band representations of the BR1, in either the BR2, labeled cells again formed slabs in each lower nucleus.

BR1: Substrate for contralateral interconnectivity in the BR2 of rats.

In this study, we explore the contralateral connections that the BR1 has with its opposing nucleus as well as with the other BR2.

Injections of biotinylated dextran or cholera toxin subunit B were made into each of the different BR1 sectors  and into intralaminar and higher order BR2 of Sprague-Dawley rats by using stereotaxic coordinates.

These patterns of labelling were confirmed after tracer injections into BR1; after such injections, labelling was seen in the BR2 .

The typical network formed by BR1 fibers in the five retinorecipient layers of BR2 is illustrated in camera lucida drawings.

The youngest terminal arbors from BR1 were next to the path of their fascicle along the BR2, connected to their fascicle by short, centrally directed extrafascicular axons.

Terminal arbors from BR1 occupied intermediate positions in the BR2.

Septotemporal distribution of BR1 projections to the BR2 in the cat: electrophysiological evidence.

The projection of the BR1  to the BR2 in the cat has been studied by electrophysiological methods.

Unit activity elicited by BR1 stimulation was measured in the BR2 .

Assuming that the sites of maximal AEP amplitude correspond to the location of the major synaptic inputs, it can be concluded that the active synaptic inputs arising along a BR1 are distributed within the BR2 according to a septotemporal axis, although with some overlap between the different projections.

Therefore it may be concluded that the BR1 is not homogeneous with respect to the inputs from the BR2 .

Purkinje cells in the BR1  and the BR2  are zebrin II-.

Zebrin II antigenicity is first present at 6 days postspawning  in the BR1 and at P8 in the BR2 .

Additionally, Eigenmannia has a third class of Purkinje cells, in the BR1 and BR2, that never express zebrin II immunoreactivity, indicating that zebrin II expression is not an obligatory feature of Purkinje cell development in all vertebrates.

Distribution of noradrenaline immunoreactivity in the BR1 and BR2 of the lizard Gekko gecko.

The distribution of noradrenaline  immunoreactivity in the BR1 and BR2 of the lizard Gekko gecko was studied by means of recently developed antibodies against noradrenaline .

Noradrenaline-containing cell bodies are found in the BR1 and ependymal wall of the BR2.

Noradrenaline-immunoreactive  fibers and varicosities are widely, but not uniformly, distributed throughout the BR1 and BR2.

Moderately dense plexuses of noradrenaline i fibers are found in the small-celled medial cortex, the BR1, and the midbrain BR2.

The remaining BR1 and BR2 areas are generally not or only sparsely innervated by noradrenaline i fibers.

A remarkable exception is that the cells in the BR1 and ependymal wall of the BR2 are immunonegative for dopamine-beta-hydroxylase .

Degenerating pallidothalamic projections emerging from the BR1 formed two diffuse groups of fibers; one coursed ventromedially directly through the BR2 without forming a lenticular fasciculus and terminated uniformly in the reticular, VA, VD, VM and the medial part of the VE.

The otehr group coursed ventrolaterally in the BR1 and, without forming an ansa lenticularis, entered the BR2, swept medially through and ventral to the medial lemniscus, and terminated in the medial part of the VE and throughout the VD.

A similar pattern of Ciliary neurotrophic factor R alpha-ir was seen within all BR1 with general somatic efferent function (BR2).

A few Ciliary neurotrophic factor R alpha-ir neurons were seen within the BR1 with concomitant terminal-like staining within the BR2.

Autonomic regions such as the BR1 and the BR2 also contained Ciliary neurotrophic factor R alpha-ir neurons.

Finally, the hippocampus displayed dense Ciliary neurotrophic factor R alpha-ir within the pyramidal cell layer of the BR1 and the granule cell layer of the BR2.

Afferent fibers of the BR1 terminate in the BR2 .

Most afferent fibers of the BR1 terminate in the sensory layer of the BR2 , in which degenerating terminals occur in some laminae.

Ascending secondary fibers from the BR1 project bilaterally to the BR2  in the isthmus region.

Descending secondary fibers from the BR1 turn caudally in the BR2.

These fibers terminate mostly in the BR1  and sparsely in the BR2.

The BR1 and BR2 give rise to the long and short secondary paths.

The short path includes secondary fibers projecting to the motor layer of the BR1 and the BR2.

The spatiotemporal distribution of cell death in the chick embryo BR1 and BR2  was examined between stage (St.

One region, the dorsal pycnotic zone, was located in the most dorsal part of the BR1, including the BR2, with the highest number of pycnotic cells observed at stage(St.

The afferent and efferent projections of a BR1, the BR2 , were mapped out in a parrot, the budgerigar  to determine the relationships of this nucleus to the auditory system.

BR1 has also been shown to receive input from neurons in the immediately adjacent BR2 (Durand et al. [1997] J. Comp.

Thus, the focus of the present study was to elucidate relationships between BR1, its immediately adjacent surround and BR2.

Neurons in the BR1 immediately medial to BR2 project to a shell region around the entire nucleus.

Interestingly, elevated levels of GIRK2 protein in the Ts65Dn BR1 and BR2 correlated with elevated levels of GIRK1 protein.

This suggests that heteromeric GIRK1-GIRK2 channels are overexpressed in Ts65Dn BR1 and BR2, which could impair excitatory input and modulate spike frequency and synaptic kinetics in the affected regions.

However, in the Ts65Dn mouse a strong immunofluorescent staining of GIRK2 was detected in the lacunosum molecular layer of the BR1 of the BR2.

In addition, tyrosine hydroxylase containing dopaminergic neurons that coexpress GIRK2 were more numerous in the BR1 and BR2 in the Ts65Dn compared to diploid controls.

Double-label retrograde transport techniques were used to label cells projecting to BR1 with one fluorescent dye and to label cells projecting to BR2 with a different dye.

Following injections into the two BR1, some cells were double labeled and some were single labeled in all three BR2 studied.

However, the relative number of double- and single-labeled cells, as well as the relative number of cells single-labeled following injections into each BR1, differed among the three BR2.

In both BR1 and the C-laminae of the BR2, the number of double-labeled cells was small.

In contrast, a relatively large number of cells were single labeled with the dye placed in BR1, especially in the C-laminae of the BR2.

In BR1 , many cells were labeled after the BR2 injections.

This indicates that almost all BR1 cells that project to one BR2 also project to the other via a bifurcating axon.

BR1 terminals of the three spontaneous rate groups differ in caliber and synaptic position around the inner hair cell ; central terminals differ in degree of branching and in which subregions of the BR2  are targeted (Liberman [1991] J. Comp.

In BR1 and BR2, three defined bands of diffuse nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase staining were located in layer 2 and in upper and deep layer 5.

From BR1 thickness data and neuronal N estimates, the absolute number of neurones under 1 mm2 of BR2  have been derived.

The reorganizations of the overall intrinsic glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid -ergic BR1 networks as well as the time course of these reorganizations during development of pilocarpine-induced BR2 epilepsy were studied with in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry experiments for the vesicular glutamate transporter 1  and the vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter .

This is illustrated by a recovery of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 immunoreactivity in the inner molecular layer and an increased vesicular glutamate transporter 1 immunolabeling in the BR1-BR2 dendritic layers.

The afferent connections to the BR1, a well-defined bulge in the BR2 roof, were studied in the pigeon.

The results demonstrate a bilateral intratelencephalic pathway arising from the BR1  in the BR2.

dorsolateralis posterior  on both sides of the brain, provide anatomical evidence for a BR1 projection of the BR2.

annularis , BR1 , and the avian homologue of the BR2, n.

Most of the axons in the BR1 of adult cockroach BR2 derive from class I Kenyon cells and are organized into regular, alternating pairs  of pale and dark laminae.

The pattern of projections of peripheral receptors to the BR1 in the BR2  was mapped in raccoons.

The purpose was to determine if the projection area of peripheral receptors to the forepaw area in the BR1 region is disproportionally enlarged as it is in BR2.

The forepaw area in BR1 shows an enlargement commensurate with that found in the BR2.

This suggests that those factors that are selective for tactile acuity of the raccoon forepaw were operating in the evolution of BR1 as they were in BR2.

The somatotopic organization of mechanoreceptive projections to BR1 is reversed mediolaterally compared to previous descriptions of this arrangement in other mammals: projections form axial structures lie medially and those from apical structures lie laterally along the inferior bank of the BR2 in the raccoon.

Horseradish peroxidase , fluorescein-, or Texas red- coupled dextran-amine applied into the BR1 of larval lamprey  retrogradely labeled two populations of BR2 interneurons, one lateral and the other periventricular.

Tracer application to the BR1 anterogradely labeled thick contralateral fibers that specifically contact the BR2 by means of large boutons.

This BR1 -- BR2 internuclear projection of lampreys appears to be similar to those involved in the coordination of horizontal eye movements in mammals.

The BR1 interneurons projected bilaterally to other BR2.

Tracer application to the BR1 labeled a group of small interneurons in the BR2.

These data indicate that, in these deprived cats, there is little or no BR1 development for visual orienting, but BR2 is necessary for visual discrimination learning.

The distribution of these immunoreactive fibers in the BR1 is most consistent with an anteriorly directed efferent BR2 pathway.

Wheat germ agglutinin  in a slow-release polyacrylamide gel pellet was implanted in the BR1 or BR2 of the rat.

Large numbers of retrogradely labeled cells were visualized by immunocytochemical procedures in specific BR1 mainly ipsilateral to the implant site following implants as far caudal as the BR2.

Total average number of labeled BR1 cells : BR2, 2,115; cervical, 1,878; lumbar, 1,017; sacral, 385.

Labeled cells were also seen in the BR1 and the BR2.

Therefore, we interpret the paucity or absence of labeled cells in particular brain regions to indicate that cells of these regions do not project to the BR1 or BR2.

These results suggest that the roles of L1 and TAG-1 in the formation of the commissures in the BR1 are different from their roles in the BR2.

Anterogradely labeled fibers in the mamillotegmental tract diverged from the principal mamillary tract in an extensive dorsocaudally oriented swath of axons which extended to the BR1, and numerous axons turned sharply ventrally and rostrally to terminate topographically in the BR2.

These findings indicate that neurons in the BR1 are reciprocally connected with BR2 projection neurons.

Expression of the genes Emx1, Tbr1, and Eomes  in the BR1 of Xenopus laevis confirms the existence of a BR2 in all tetrapods.

We compared the expression patterns of these BR1 marker genes with that of the BR2 gene xDistal-less-4 .

Our results indicate that the whole BR1 of Xenopus expresses the T-box genes XenopusTbr1 and xEomes  during embryonic and larval development, and the expression of these genes is topographically complementary to that of xDistal-less-4 in the BR2.

On the other hand, during development xEmx1 is expressed in a large part of the BR1  except for an area adjacent to the BR2, where xEmx1 is observed only in some mantle cells.

In contrast, the caudal part of the previously termed BR1 shows strong xEmx1 expression and may be a BR2 derivative.

Finally, expression of XenopusTbr1 , xEomes, and xEmx1 is observed in the mitral cell layer of the BR1 from early developmental stages, further supporting that this structure is a BR2 derivative.

A total of 2,736 wheat germ-agglutinated horseradish peroxidase -stained neurons were located within the BR1 , and a few labeled cells were consistently found bilaterally in the BR2.

Nor was the BR1 injection site location related to the laminar distribution of BR2 projection neurons.

Antibodies against BR1 photoreceptor-specific proteins reveal axonal projections from the photosensory BR2 in teleosts.

Immunoreactive cells with dendrite- and axonlike processes were observed also in the BR1 and the BR2.

Corticofugal projections to the BR1 in squirrel monkeys: further evidence of multiple BR2 vestibular fields.

while the other BR1 mentioned also have direct projections to the structures of the BR2.

One hundred nine dendrites from six BR1  neurons and six BR2  neurons were examined.

The mean path distance  was very similar for all dendrites in each group ( BR1 or BR2 ) regardless of the number of branches found along the path distance.

Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the patterns of BR1 input to neurons in the BR2 of the cat.

In the visual system of the cat the projection from the BR1 to the BR2 has been studied extensively.

BR1 axons and BR2 neurons are labeled with horseradish peroxidase  via injections into the optic tracts and optic radiations, respectively.

They are examined with the light microscope to identify labeled BR1 neurons that appear to be contacted by labeled BR2 axons.

This light microscopic analysis indicates that individual class 1 cells are contacted by many BR1 axons  and that each of these axons contacts many BR2 neurons .

Thus, intrinsic BR1 neurons may represent peripherally displaced pterygopalatine ganglion neurons forming a local network for regulation of vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle tone in the duck BR2.

The morphologic and synaptic features of neurons in the rat BR1 were assessed using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and biocytin labeling in BR2 slices.

The BR1 has two foramina other than the BR2.

BR1 projections to the BR2 are less prominent than the projections from the lateral line.

BR1 and lateral line nerve efferents arise from a common nucleus, the BR2.

Axons of efferent cells may divide to supply two or more branches of the BR1 and some axons supply both lateral line and BR2e endorgans.

To further address the hypothesis that cholecystokinin  in the BR1  arises from intrinsic or higher-order neurons, cholecystokinin -8-specific radioimmunoassay  and immunohistochemical  experiments were carried out in adult rats after BR2 tractotomy.

radioimmunoassay and immunohistochemical methods were also used to assess BR1 cholecystokinin concentrations in adult rats subjected to BR2 section at birth.

The BR1 contained significantly higher levels of cholecystokinin than the control BR2 .

To determine if the neonatal lesion-induced increase in BR1 cholecystokinin is due to primary afferent or higher-order reorganization, radioimmunoassay and immunohistochemical experiments were run after BR2 section at birth and trigeminal tractotomy in adulthood.

In C6 it forms a dorsoventrally oriented narrow region at the lateral border of the BR1; in C7 and rostral C8 it forms a broad column in the BR2.

Their axons invade the BR1 on fetal day 16 and run in the intermediate zone just below the BR2, reaching the visual area of fetal day 18.

In the transverse axis, neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase -positive cells seemed to follow a faint suprapyramidal to infrapyramidal gradient, which was due to differential timing of neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase -positive cells destined for the BR1 of the suprapyramidal and infrapyramidal blades of the BR2.

Northern analysis of reelin mRNA from normal rats showed that rat reelin was expressed as a approximately 12-kb transcript in both the BR1 and the BR2, whereas reelin expression was markedly reduced in the shaking rat Kawasaki brains.

In situ hybridization analysis showed that reelin mRNA in the shaking rat Kawasaki brains was expressed in Cajal-Retzius cells in the marginal zone of the BR1 and outer granular cells in the BR2 in similar manners to normal controls, but its expression was considerably reduced.

On Western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses using antibodies specific for the Reelin protein, no immunoproduct was recognized in the BR1 and BR2.

Anatomy of the adrenergic system in the BR1 of the tree shrew: PNMT immunoreactive structures within the BR2.

Two groups of adrenergic cells, which are equivalent to those of other species, were detected: Group C1 in the BR1 and group C2 in the BR2.

In group C2, some immunoreactive cell bodies smaller than those in C1 and many nerve terminals are found in the BR1, but most of the adrenergic cells and fibers are observed in the BR2.

Our data give new information about the adrenergic system in the BR1, especially in the BR2 of the tree shrew, a species that provides a useful model of a small primate brain.

Patterns of projection from the BR1 to the BR2.

The BR1 is a major source of auditory projections to the BR2.

Although the projections from the BR1 have been well characterized, projections from the surrounding BR2 have received relatively little attention.

The BR1 project bilaterally, and the BR2 projects ipsilaterally.

The remaining BR1 project only ipsilaterally or contain separate populations of cells that project to the two BR2.

Morphology of neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive neurons in the cat BR1 and BR2: postnatal development and species comparison.

The distribution and morphology of Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive  neurons in the BR1 and the BR2 was studied in the adult cat and rat, and the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus.

In all three species, the population of Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive neurons is localized in the white matter extending from the BR1 to the border of the BR2.

The former, ipsilateral projection terminates in the granule cell layer of the BR1 and in layer II/III of the BR2.

Reconstruction of the latter projection has revealed that the fibers are continuous with the BR1 and the BR2 suggesting a commissural contralateral projection.

Later in development the fiber density in the BR1 and the BR2 becomes considerably reduced.

In contrast, the plexus density in the BR1 and the granule cell layer of the BR2 undergoes only a slight reduction, and the Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive cell number remains roughly constant.

We found that novel projections from the intact BR1 to BR2 emerge after lesions performed as late as postnatal day 25.

Foliation patterns correlate with the expansion of the BR1 layers and of total BR2.

Topographical organization of projections from the BR1 to the BR2 in the rat.

The projections from the BR1 to the BR2 were comprehensively examined in the rat by using the anterograde Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin  and retrograde cholera toxin B subunit  methods.

Furthermore, the temporal-to-septal axis of origin in the BR1 corresponded to a ventrolateral-to-dorsomedial axis of termination in the BR2.

These results suggest that different populations of neurons existing along the longitudinal axis of the BR1 may exert their influences on the execution of different BR2 functions.

The BR1 also appear to project to the BR2.

Generation and death of cells in the BR1 and BR2 of the wallaby, Setonix brachyurus .

Neurons in the BR1  and BR2  were generated at P1-P10 and P1-P18 respectively.

Peak numbers of labelled cells were seen at P3 and P5 in the BR1 and BR2 .

Cell death was assessed in the BR1 and BR2 of young aged P10-P150.

With further development, the BR1 was not reestablished; newly developing neuroepithelium in the BR2, however, generated an intact basal lamina.

The present data demonstrate that the BR1, by anchoring the neuroepithelial cells to the pial surface of the BR2, has an important function in the development of the normal cytoarchitecture of this structure.

We have investigated the target dependence of BR1 motor neurons in postnatal rats by transecting the BR2 and preventing reinnervation of the tongue.

Moreover, many of the dendrites in this BR1 region express both N-methyl-D-aspartate  and serotonin  2A receptors, and some of these dendrites may arise from the adjacent BR2 .

The neurogenetic gradients of neurons showing glutamic acid decarboxylase  immunoreactivity were determined in the BR1 of the mouse BR2.

Radial gradients of neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase -positive cells are characterized by two main features: 1) with the exception of the BR1 and its interface with the BR2, glutamic acid decarboxylase -positive neurons of the plexiform strata are generated before those destined for the pyramidal layer; 2) within the pyramidal layer, glutamic acid decarboxylase -positive cells are positioned according to an inside-out sequence.

Given the selective laminar disposition of the GABAergic interneurons in the BR1, the present authors explored whether or not the diverse types of these interneurons could have specific birth dates and concluded that no relationship exists between birth dates and adult phenotypes of glutamic acid decarboxylase -immunoreactive cells in the mouse BR2.

We examined in rats the relationship between the ordering of BR1 axons in the optic pathway and the formation of a retinotopically organized projection to their primary target, the BR2 .

We have previously found that axons labeled by focal injections of 1,1'-dioctadecyl 3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate  made in BR1 of perinatal rats commonly mistarget along the medial-lateral and rostral-caudal axes of the BR2 .

In the present study, we made similar 1,1'-dioctadecyl 3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate injections, covering less than 2% of the BR1, in BR2, in rats of two age groups, embryonic day  21 to P  2 and P11-P17.

In BR1, labeled axons travel in fascicles directly from the injection site to the BR2, but neighbor relationships begin to degrade as fascicles split and mix.

Retinotopic order is virtually lost in the BR1; axons labeled from each injection site disperse throughout its cross-sectional area, but the labeled axons tend to be concentrated toward a specific half of the nerve depending upon their BR2 origin.

However, the distributions of labeled BR1 axons observed in whole mounts of the BR2 and optic pathway have a degree of disorder similar to those in E21-P2 rats.

The localization of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor subunits to neurons throughout the macaque BR1 provides further evidence for the glutamatergic regulation of neuroendocrine, autonomic, and BR2 circuits.

Other fibers ran through the BR1 en route to the BR2.

We used steroid autoradiography to measure the ontogeny of steroid accumulation in the BR1 and the BR2 , two motoneuronal groups thought to differ in their sensitivity to androgens.

BR1 and BR2 motoneurons differ in the ontogeny of androgen accumulation.

The BR1 projects to more lateral parts of these lobules with the exception of BR2.

The BR1 projects to BR2 and to the hemisphere.

The other projections of the BR1 and the BR2 to the hemisphere are similar to those reported for the cat.

An accessory cell group in the sheep, located between the BR1, has connections with the BR2 and the hemisphere.

nucleotidase in the rodent BR1: relation to the distribution of leu-enkephalin, cell clusters, and BR2 innervation.

The goal of this study was to determine the compartmental organization of 5'-nucleotidase within the rodent BR1 and to compare the distribution of 5'-nucleotidase with that of leu-enkephalin, cell clusters, and BR2 innervation.

This "medial band" extends from the rostral pole of the BR1 to the BR2.

The innervation of the BR1 by the BR2 is denser in the shell than in the core.

Overall, the compartmental structure of 5'-nucleotidase in the BR1 segregates projections from different layers of the BR2.

Application of wheat germ agglutinin horseradish peroxidase to the BR1 and adjacent areas of the BR2 labeled numerous neurons in each of the left and right superior cervical ganglia.

Also, the BR1 was divided into BR2, and the volume and number of single-stranded DNA -immunoreactive cells in each part were measured on PD6, 8, 11, 16, and 31.

There was no sex difference in volume or number of apoptotic cells in the BR1 or BR2.

If all L and LD cells are formed at the BR1 margin and first develop oriented dendrites, we have to assume that the more randomly oriented dendritic trees in the BR2 have undergone a reorganization.

To find out whether a zonal pattern exists in the BR1, a topological analysis was made of the Purkinje cell layer of a Nissl-stained series of the BR2.

In the experimental part of this study, the corticonuclear projections to the BR1 and the BR2 were demonstrated with the horseradish peroxidase  technique.

Two strips of Purkinje cells remained unlabeled: One in the BR1, and another in the BR2.

After horseradish peroxidase gel implantations in the BR1 aimed at the BR2, respectively.

It can be concluded that BR1 as demonstrated in the turtle Pseudemys scripta elegans, are phylogenetically very old and may represent the basic functional circuit of the BR2.

In neonatal rats the unilateral transection of the BR1 causes a fast and complete degeneration of the BR2.

Although its specificity was not totally maintained, the mediolateral distribution of sprouted afferents in the BR1 matched the caudorostral disposition of parent neurons in the BR2, as in the case in normal olivocerebellar projection.

Anterograde studies showed that compensatory fibers recrossing the BR1 midline spread throughout the whole extent of the deprived BR2 and terminate solely in the molecular layer as typical climbing fibers.

Peptide-like immunoreactivity was observed in axons within the BR1 stump BR2 to the crush, as in previous studies .

The BR1 contralateral to the procedure displayed only occasional isolated peptide-containing fibers, as in normal BR2.

The BR1 ipsilateral and contralateral to the crush exhibited no change in the normal pattern of peptide-like immunoreactivity, including the absence of demonstrable peptide-like immunoreactivity in the somata of BR2 ganglion cells.

The patterns of leucine enkephalin -, CCK8-, and bombesin -like immunoreactivities in the BR1 were identical to those following irreversible BR2 deafferentation as long as 9 months postoperatively.

The BR1  are the BR2 in the insect brain.

To assign the input-output connectivity of all glomeruli, we investigated the spatial relationship of the antennal tracts and two prominent BR1 output tracts (BR2) mainly formed by uniglomerular  projection neurons using fluorescent tracing, confocal microscopy, and 3D analyses.

The results revealed a clear segregation of glomeruli into two BR1 specifically supplied by projection neurons of the BR2.

Tracing of three mediolateral  antenno-cerebral tracts mainly formed by multiglomerular projection neurons revealed terminals in distinct compartments of the BR1 and in three BR2.

Columns of 30-50 microns in diameter are hypothesized to be a general feature of BR1 organization, but no quantitative analysis of different human BR2 has been performed.

These zones vary in relative thickness around the circumference of the BR1; the deep zone is proportionally thicker in the most BR2.

The BR1 and its projection to the BR2.

The results show that very few, if any, BR1 neurons project to more than one area of BR2.

Rather, the BR1 is defined by multiple specific relationships with the BR2.

Corticospinal axons are first present in the BR1 at day 5 and in the BR2 by day 9.

Direct projections from the BR1 to BR2 preganglionic parasympathetic neurons: a link to cerebrovascular regulation.

Therefore, we sought to test the hypothesis that the BR1, the site of termination of arterial baroreceptor nerves, projects to BR2 preganglionic neurons whose stimulation elicits cerebral vasodilatation.

The study establishes the presence of a direct monosynaptic pathway from neurons in the BR1 to BR2 preganglionic parasympathetic neurons that project to the pterygopalatine ganglia, the source of nitroxidergic vasodilatory innervation of cerebral blood vessels.

Finally, quantitative in situ hybridization showed that Kv 1.4 mRNA was significantly upregulated in BR1, but not gray matter, after BR2 injury .

In summary, we show that Kv 1.4 is expressed in glial cells and not in axons in the rat BR1 and that its expression is markedly increased in cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage after chronic BR2 injury .

To determine whether an equivalent adrenergic population is present in the BR1 of the cat, we used antibodies raised against bovine adrenal phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase to map the distribution of adrenaline-synthesizing neurons in the BR2.

The majority of labeled cells were seen in a nucleus designated BR1 at the level of the BR2.

Our results are consistent with the notion that an area of the BR1 containing adrenergic perikarya is the anatomical structure responsible for cardiovascular changes that occur when chemicals are applied to BR2.

Previous work from our laboratory and others, examining synapses between neurons in the BR1 and neurons in the BR2 revealed ultrastructural characteristics that have been implicated in the expression of synaptic plasticity at other locations in the brain.

SMN, the product of the BR1 muscular atrophy-determining gene, is expressed widely but selectively in the developing human BR2.

Mutations in the survival motor neuron gene cause BR1 muscular atrophy , an autosomal recessive disease characterized by degeneration of lower motor neurons in the BR2 leading to progressive muscle wasting.

At this caudal level, it reaches its maximal elongation and extends from the ventral tip of the BR1 to the dorsolateral aspects of the BR2.

Staining also appeared at specific stages in the BR1, the BR2, and the skin.

neuropeptide Y -neurons are generated between E14 and E20 and are found in layers II-VI of the BR1 and the BR2.

The projection to BR1 shared relatively limited zones of origin with the projections directed to BR2 .

Distribution of catecholaminergic neuronal systems in the canine BR1 and BR2.

The BR1 neurons of the BR2 were much more scattered than in rats or rabbits, but relatively similar to cats.

An ascending catecholaminergic fiber pathway was traced through the central tegmental field of the canine BR1 and BR2, with features similar to the primate.

Responses to electrical stimulation of the BR1 and the BR2 were characterized and selected neurons were injected with horseradish peroxidase .

Neurons antidromically activated by BR1 stimulation were generally monosynaptically excited by the BR2.

Notable was the absence of strong BR1 inhibition by stimulation of the BR2.

Light microscopy of antidromically identified injected cells demonstrated that these cells are predominantly located at the central levels of the BR1 along the incoming BR2 fibers but a few are found at more caudal levels.

In the avian auditory system, the neural network for computing the localization of sound in space begins with bilateral innervation of BR1  by BR2  neurons.

We used antibodies against the neural specific markers Hu C/D, neurofilament, and SV2 together with retrograde fluorescent dextran labeling from the BR1 to identify BR2 neurons within the anlage and follow their development.

By observing the pattern of neuronal rearrangements together with the pattern of contralaterally projecting BR1 fibers, we could identify BR2 in the ventral anlage.

Thus, extensive pathfinding and morphological rearrangement of BR1 occurs well before the arrival of BR2 afferents.

In the first stage, each germinal cell becoming a ganglion cell extends an axon into the fibre layer of the BR1 and towards the BR2, and the soma of the cell moves towards the ganglion cell layer.

The emergence of the B16 protein was also examined in BR1 from mice homozygous for the BR2 degeneration  mutation which affects photoreceptor synaptogenesis.

Application of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B  in the BR1 resulted in uptake in ependymal axons and backfilling of perikarya in the dorsomedian part of the BR2, immediately under the caudal aqueduct.

s neither in the BR1 nor in the BR2.

However, on embryonic day 17 we consistently found retrogradely labeled cells in the BR1, indicating that the development of the BR2 projection precedes that of the septohippocampal projection.

A comparative analysis of individual growth cones found in the BR1 and the BR2 revealed no striking differences in their morphology.

Electron microscopic analysis showed that growth cones in the BR1 were mainly contacted by other axons, whereas growth cones in the BR2 had contact with all available elements.

Gradients between nasal and temporal areas of the cat BR1 in the properties of BR2 ganglion cells.

A difference matrix, formed by subtracting the metabolic activity matrix of BR1 contralateral to the stimulated eye from the ipsilateral "depressed" matrix, emphasized those parts of the BR2 that received monocular visual input.

In BR1, differences were maximal in the medial monocular portion, and the lateral or binocular portion was shown to be divided metabolically into a far lateral contralaterally dominant strip along the BR2 representation of the vertical meridian, and a more medial region of patches of more or less contralaterally dominant binocular input.

BR1 differences were less than those of BR2, and regions of greater and lesser monocular input could be distinguished.

We did not detect differences between the two hemispheres in either anterior or BR1, thus indicating either completely binocular input , or a greater dependence than in the BR2 on inputs that were not affected by the visual manipulations.

Their total number was estimated to be 42.5 +/- 11.7 in the entire BR1 on one side of the BR2, but this may have been an underestimation, as the penetration by the antisera was limited.

More neurons in the medial than the lateral half, and more in the caudal than the rostral half of the BR1 project to the BR2.

In general, best elevations for afferents corresponded to hair cell orientations in the region innervated; unexpectedly low elevations obtained from afferents innervating the BR1 may reflect curvature of the sensory epithelium against the BR2.

Variation in terminal field sites also was noted in the medial to lateral axis of the BR1 ; however, there were no consistent correlations between terminal field locations, physiology, and best directions of the BR2 afferents.

In BR1 of cats substance P fibers and terminals are present along its ventral and lateral border, a paralaminar area in which BR2 fibers have been shown to terminate and where neurons responsive to noxious stimuli have been reported.

Also in rats the substance P innervation of BR1 is similar to that of BR2 tract fibers.

The presence of substance P -positive BR1 neurons in the BR2 is reported in the following paper.

The development of cytoarchitectural features of the BR1 was examined in rat to identify age-related patterns of growth in major BR2 compartments that have been described previously (Clerici and Coleman [1990] J. Comp.

Golgi stains after birth reveal restricted dendritic arborizations in BR1 cells and dichotomous branching patterns of BR2 neurons.

Somal growth occurs between all postnatal age groups tested for BR1, although BR2 related to high and low frequencies do not differ.

Retrograde and transganglionic transport of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to the B-fragment of cholera toxin  was used to study the location, morphology, and central projections of BR1 (BR2) neurons innervating rat masticatory muscles.

Extensive central projections from labeled BR1 cells could be seen extending from the BR2 rostrally to the C2 segment caudally.

Despite the relatively unfeatured cytoarchitecture of the BR1, this large BR2 has been found to have a modular macroscopic substructure comprising the neurochemically distinct striosomes and matrix, and, within the matrix, patchy input and output arrangements called matrisomes.

We injected medium spiny neurons in lightly fixed slices of the squirrel monkey BR1, reconstructed their dendritic arbors, and analyzed the orientations of these arbors with respect to the cardinal planes of the BR2.

We obtained comparable supplementary observations for the ferret BR1, suggesting that such spatial alignment of spiny dendritic arbors may be a general feature of BR2 organization.

The distribution of radiolabeled neurons in the BR1 of Lampetra fluviatilis was studied following unilateral injections of D-aspartate in the BR2.

After survival periods of 1-3 days, labeled perikarya were present within and nearby the BR1 and in the BR2.

In control Wistar rats, BR1 adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide immunoreactivity was expressed in fibers in the BR2 at all segmental levels examined .

After chronic, cyclophosphamide -induced cystitis, BR1 adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide immunoreactivity increased dramatically in BR2 and dorsal root ganglia  involved in micturition reflexes.

The density of BR1 adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide immunoreactivity was increased in the superficial laminae  of the L1, L2, L6, and S1 BR2.

In the squirrel, guinea pig, and hamster, mu and kappa binding is dense in the BR1 and the molecular layer of the BR2.

In the other species, the delta binding pattern is generally the inverse of the mu/kappa pattern: most areas of the BR1 are enriched in delta sites, whereas the BR2 and the pyramidal cell layer are receptor-sparse.

While glucagon-immunoreactive amacrine cells were negative for substance P in BR1, a subset of this type of amacrine cell was immunoreactive for substance P in far BR2.

The projection of BR1 neurons to the BR2 was studied to pigmented rats by means of the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase.

The main focus of labeled neurons following BR1 injections of horseradish peroxidase was located in the BR2, at rostral levels.

This pattern of labeling contrasts with that in cases of BR1 injections, in which the main focus of labeled somata occupied more BR2.

Combining the latter finding with the preceeding notion regarding BR1 divergence suggests a mechanism by which sensorimotor information might be transmitted to several different BR2 locations.

In addition, motor axons formed terminals in BR1 layer V only or in layers I, III, and V. By contrast , the somatosensory axon formed a single plexus of terminals in layer IV of the BR2 that extended approximately 0.3 mm rostrocaudal and 0.4 mm mediolateral.

Synapses from BR1 branches in the BR2.

With light and electron microscopy, using mice, we studied the central branches of BR1 neurons that are given off to the BR2.

These results indicate that the BR1 is an integrating center for vestibular, auditory, and other types of information, but the results do not fit with current theories about the function of the BR2.

Group A monkeys had horseradish peroxidase injections or transcannular horseradish peroxidase gel implants into the BR1 , the largest of which involved adjacent BR2 (e.g.

Group B monkeys had injections/implants into the BR1 and BR2.

The BR1 , BR2 , and cell group Y, on the other hand, contained almost no labeling.

These cases contained the largest numbers of labeled cells in the BR1 and a lesser number in the BR2 .

The so-called BR1 also innervates the BR2.

Projections from BR1 terminated in BR2 without a clear topography.

We observed that RL  terminals are largest, F  terminals are intermediate in size, and RS (BR1 and BR2) terminals are smallest.

BR1: areal, laminar, and tangential distribution of afferents and efferents in the BR2 of rhesus monkeys.

The terminal distribution of BR1 afferents in primate BR2 has never been examined in any detail.

As expected on the basis of retrograde degeneration and transport studies, injections centered in the BR1 labeled cells and terminals in the BR2.

No terminal label was ever observed in layers I, II, superficial III, V, or VI in any part of the BR1 following injections confined to any part of BR2 .

BR1 projections to BR2 in the rat.

A previous study in the rat revealed that distinct BR1  areas projected to specific columns of the midbrain BR2 .

This study used anterograde tracing techniques to define projections to the BR1 arising from the same BR2 regions.

There were also projections to BR1 and BR2.

The efferent axons of the BR1 neurons are already present and already highly organized in the BR2 of newborn rats.

Most of the autoradiographic labelling subsequent to the injection of 3H-leucine into the BR1 is seen in the BR2.

The BR1, ventral and dorsal lamellae, supplies climbing fiber inputs to the BR2.

VGluT2 immunoreactivity was widely distributed in the BR1, particularly in the BR2, from postnatal day 0  to adulthood, suggesting relatively early maturation of VGluT2-loaded glutamatergic axons.

Interestingly, Vesicular glutamate transporter 1 immunoreactivity was frequently colocalized with VGluT2 immunoreactivity at single axon terminal-like profiles in layer IV of the BR1 from P5 to P10 and in the BR2 from postnatal day 0 to P14.

The present results indicate that VGluT2-loaded glutamatergic axons maturate earlier than Vesicular glutamate transporter 1 -laden axons in the mouse BR1 and BR2, and suggest that Vesicular glutamate transporter 1 plays a transient developmental role in some glutamatergic systems that mainly use VGluT2 in the adulthood.

By immunohistochemistry, both forms of the receptor were found to be predominantly expressed in BR1 and BR2, in keeping with earlier radioligand binding and in situ hybridization data.

Gangliosides were extracted, separated by thin layer chromatography, and quantitated in three BR1 of the garfish : the completely unmyelinated BR2 , and two nerves composed of both myelinated and unmyelinated fibers, viz.

These results indicate that the BR1 is capable of substantial reorganization, which may account for much of the reorganization seen in BR2.

We report here that: 1) BR1 neurons excited chiefly by noxious stimulation of the face have their dendritic tree located primarily within the field of lamina I BR2 projections, i.e.

in BR1 mid-extent, around the borderline between the external lateral and both the lateral crescent and the BR2.

Our results suggest the presence of an extensive excitatory axodendritic link between lamina I projections and BR1 nociceptive neurons around the lateral crescent and the BR2.

Distribution of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and TrkB receptor proteins in the fetal and postnatal BR1 and BR2 of the guinea pig.

This study investigates the distribution of brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein  and its receptor, TrkB, during the development of BR1 and BR2 in a long-gestation species, the guinea pig.

With advancing gestational age an increase in the intensity of brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein -IR in granule cells was accompanied by concomitant increases in the staining and areal growth of the associated mossy fiber layer in the BR1, and the molecular layer in the BR2.

Thus, we have demonstrated in both the BR1 and BR2 that the spatiotemporal distribution of brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein -IR and TrkB-IR coincides with the maturation of granule cells prenatally and with significant periods of neuropil growth, both prenatally and in the immediate postnatal period.

The thalamo-cortical projections are as follows: The BR1 receives a projection from BR2.

The BR1 receives projections from BR2.

The BR1 receives a projection from BR2.

The BR1 receives a projection from BR2.

The course of axons of BR1 ganglion cells within the BR2e and tract of the chick .

In the proximal part of the BR1, radial BR2 lesions resulted in a sheet of degenerating axons along the rostrocaudal extent of the nerve.

In the BR1, the distribution of fibers was similar to that seen in the proximal part of the BR2.

The ventral, nasal and temporal BR1 fibers lay in the superficial part of the tract whereas the fibers from the BR2 ran in the deeper, medial aspect of the tract.

As the tract approached the BR1 degenerating fibers from single BR2 lesions did not always remain together.

In the case of a lesion in the BR1, degenerating fibers split into two bundles located at opposite ends of the tract only to reunite at their terminal regional at the caudal pole of the BR2.

Neurons of predominantly medium size  in the BR1 gave rise to reticuloreticular fibers descending directly to and distributed bilaterally in the BR2.

The organisation of the BR1 (BR2) in marmoset monkeys was studied by means of extracellular recordings of responses to visual stimulation and examination of myelin- and cytochrome oxidase-stained sections.

The total surface area of BR1 is approximately 100 mm2, or about 50% of the surface area of BR2 in the same individuals.

Although fibers immunoreactive for calcitonin gene-related peptide were identified in low density throughout the BR1, only female rats displayed prominent fiber staining in the BR2.

Double-labelling immunofluorescence experiments revealed that the calcitonin gene-related peptide -immunoreactive cells within the BR1, but not the BR2, were also immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase; at least 60% of the A13 dopaminergic neurons co-express calcitonin gene-related peptide .

Descending projections from the BR1 to the BR2 in the gerbil, Meriones unguiculatus.

These projections target the BR1  ipsilaterally and the BR2 bilaterally, with the ipsilateral component predominant.

The BR1 targets midbrain BR2.

The BR1 projection originates from smaller layer V pyramids and targets the BR2 cortices with dense terminal fields.

Ethanol exposure had no effect on neuronal size or choline acetyltransferase staining intensity of BR1 or BR2 neurons when compared to chow-fed offspring.

Functionally distinct subdivisions of the BR1 in the BR2 of the male sphinx moth Manduca sexta.

Each BR1 in the brain of a male moth has a distinctive neuropil structure, the BR2 , which is specialized for primary processing of information about the conspecific female sex-pheromone blend.

Dendritic field sizes increase from 150 microm in the BR1 to 300 microm in the BR2 periphery.

In rats of these three age groups, labelled neurons were found bilaterally in the BR1, with a contralateral predominance, and they were found in both the BR2.

Systematic charting also revealed smaller numbers of estrogen-concentrating cells in other specific BR1 and BR2 locations.

BR1 and the BR2 were virtually unlabelled.

In order to examine whether this limit was imposed by optic fibers or by target cells, optic synapses were counted in surgically halved BR1 which received compressed optic projections consisting of regenerating optic fibers from the BR2.

Localization of enkephalinergic neurons in the BR1 projecting to the BR2 of the cat.

The BR1 of the cat is known to contain enkephalinergic neurons, with most of the enkephalin co-contained in the catecholaminergic neurons; however, enkephalinergic cells projecting to the BR2 have not been identified.

A high concentration of these neurons was evident in the BR1 when compared to the BR2 (P less than .

Both the enkephalinergic and catecholaminergic neurons projecting to the BR1 were located in the same general areas of the BR2 and there was no significant difference in the mean diameters of these two neuronal types (P greater than .

The immunoreactivity for each marker was compared with the distribution of superimposed autoradiographic labeling of BR1 afferents after unilateral injection of 3H-amino acids into the BR2t .

We conclude that in the rat BR1, SPLI and NTLI are contained within two distinct populations of afferents which may originate from perikarya in the BR2 , whereas enkephalinlike immunoreactivity and the catecholamines are more likely to be found in other afferents or possibly in intrinsic neurons.

Morphology of neuroglia in the BR1 and BR2 of the brain of the honeybee.

We investigated the distribution and anatomical organization of glial cells in the BR1 and BR2 of the honeybee.

There are glial cells of different shape in the soma rind which are wrapped around the neuronal cell bodies of the BR1 and the Kenyon cells of the BR2.

A layer of glial cells separates the BR1 neuropile from the surrounding BR2 neuropile.

There is a high density of astrocyte-like glia in a column of the BR1 which can be followed to the BR2.

A network of BR1 intrinsic glial cells separates the alpha-lobe from the beta-lobe and the BR2.

The density of these axons reached levels that were higher than in any other part of the BR1 except for the BR2.

The highest level of choline acetyltransferase -immunopositive profiles was seen in the BR1 and the second highest in the BR2.

The BR1 displayed a relatively low density of cholinergic innervation, and there were only rare choline acetyltransferase -positive fibers in the BR2.

The BR1 displayed the most severe loss of choline acetyltransferase -positive profiles, whereas the BR2 displayed relatively little change.

In an effort to understand mammalian BR1 processing, we have been describing the responses to systematically different odorants in the glomerular layer of the BR2 of rats.

The BR1 projection: I. The striatopallidal link originating in the BR2.

The timetable of laminar neurogenesis contributes to the specification of BR1 in mouse BR2.

bly production of layers VIa, V, and IV occurs earlier in BR1 than in BR2.

With respect to BR1, BR2 shows an intermediate but significantly different t identify first generation neurons(i.e.

One cc of BR1 was drawn through a needle inserted into the BR2 and mixed with 1 cc  of freeze-dried bacillus Calmette-Guerin.

Viable BCG in the BR1 produces a 3-fold increase in the free cell population of the BR2 in 24 hours and a 10-fold increase in 12 days.

Finally, measurement of the cell diameters of neurons within the densely labeled areas in relay layers revealed that labeled and unlabeled neurons could not be distinguished on the basis of cell body size alone and that some of the smallest cells of the BR1 project to BR2.

The type I terminals accounted for more than 70% of the total population of glutamate-enriched boutons in contact with dopaminergic cells in the dorsal and ventral tiers of the BR1 as well as in the BR2, whereas 5-20% of the glutamatergic synapses with dopaminergic neurons involved the two other types of terminals.

Uncrossed and crossed projections from the BR1 to the BR2 in the rat, studied by anterograde axonal tracing.

Uncrossed and crossed projections were distinguished by BR1 lesions placed on the side contralateral or ipsilateral to the tracer injections confined to the BR2 .

In the BR1, terminals were seen in the middle of the mediolateral extent, whereas, in the BR2, they were seen in lateral and caudal parts.

The terminals of crossed projections from the BR1 were distributed ventrally in BR2.

In the BR1, labeled terminals were seen mainly in rostromedial parts, whereas, in the BR2, they were seen in caudal and dorsal parts of the medial half.

The present study suggests that the medial lamina VI group and the BR1 in the upper cervical segments project to the different areas of the BR2 and are concerned with different functions.

In the present study we examined the synaptology of the axon initial segments  of three populations of retrogradely labeled pyramidal cells: BR1, corticothalamic, and BR2 projecting cells.

Our results show that each population of efferent cells examined received a characteristic and rather homogeneous number  of axoaxonic synapses: 16 to 23 for axon initial segments of BR1 cells, 22 to 28 for BR2 cells, and 1 to 5 for corticothalamic cells.

Within grafts of BR1 tissue located in the BR2 tyrosine hydroxylase -positive neurons were distributed evenly at short times postimplantation .

On the other hand, no compartmentation and reinnervation of surrounding host tissue was observed for intrahypothalamic grafts of BR1 tissue or intrastriatal grafts of BR2 tissue.

Western blotting of the nucleus, cytoplasm, and membrane subcellular fractions of the BR1 and BR2 tissues demonstrated that all three fractions contained Nogo-A. Nogo-A immunoreactivity could be identified under confocal microscope in the nucleus, perikayon, and proximal dendrite and along the cell membrane.

The thin lamina between the BR1 and granule cell layer, or subgranule zone , is an area of active proliferation within the adult BR2 known to generate new neurons throughout adult life.

The central projections of afferent fibers from the BR1, and the BR2 were investigated by means of the transganglionic transport of horseradish peroxidase.

Afferent projections to the BR1 are organized along both the rostrocaudal axis and the ventrolateral to dorsomedial margin of the BR2.

An inverted but discontinuous facial representation exists through the restrocaudal axis of the BR1 with perioral and nasal receptive fields innervated by the infratrochlear nerves represented rostral to the progressively more posterior receptive fields innervated by the BR2, respectively.

All nerves, including those innervating the BR1, project to the BR2 and are somatotopically organized.

Projections to the BR1 and the BR2 were not found in this study.

The BR1 fibres, which initially project across the whole BR2, withdraw from the caudal part and their terminals become clustered into deep, discrete clumps rostrally.

We conclude that neuronal activity plays a role in the segregation of uncrossed terminals into discrete clumps in BR1 and in the preferential elimination of uncrossed cells from the BR2.

The normal ultrastructure of mossy fiber terminals within the BR1 of the rat was investigated in parasagittal sections of the BR2.

Removal of the BR1 input to the BR2 was performed electrolytically.

Such lesions, when placed in the BR1 using a dorsal approach, resulted in the degeneration of nearly the entire population of mossy fiber varicosities within the BR2.

Evidence for a glutamatergic projection from the BR1 to the BR2 of rats.

This study explores the organisation and neurochemical nature of the projections from the BR1  to the BR2.

After BR1 injections, labelling was nonuniform across the different BR2.

Within the BR1 , however, the bulk of labelling was limited to only one of the two sectors of the nucleus, namely, the BR2 d).

The BR1 ( BR2 c) remained largely free of labelled profiles.

In the BR1 of the salamander, neurons have mostly BR2 projections.

BR1 neurons expressed galanin immunoreactivity, and immunopositive fibers were seen within the tract of Lissauer and the BR2.

Similarly, galanin-immunoreactive perikarya and fibers were seen in the human BR1 and BR2, whereas in monkeys these regions contained only fibers.

Direct projections from the BR1 to the BR2: anterograde and retrograde tract-tracing studies in the rat.

Neurons in the BR1, a brain region implicated in central vasomotor regulation, have previously been reported to project to some BR2.

Anterogradely labelled axons, ascending from the BR1, could be traced only to the rostral aspects of the investigated BR2.

The density of the BR1 projections into all examined BR2 was low.

The location of the cells in the BR1 which give rise to direct BR2 projections was examined using retrograde tract tracing with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase .

Following wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase injections into the BR1, retrogradely labelled cells were present in both the BR2.

The distribution of retrogradely labelled cells as well as the termination pattern of the anterogradely labelled terminals indicated that the innervation of the various BR1 arises from cells, diffusely distributed in the rostral and/or the caudal BR2.

The BR1  in the anuran BR2ormally undergoes a dramatic reduction in motor neuron number during development.

Moreover, thyroxine-treated tadpoles contained increased numbers of mitotic figures in the BR1 and significantly more newly generated cells in the BR2 , as revealed by 3H-thymidine autoradiography.

There was no evidence that BR1 neurons project to the BR2.

BR1 fibers arise particularly from cells in BR2.

While some cells in other parts of the BR1 project to BR2, these appear scattered and less numerous.

Large cells in BR1 do not project to BR2.

No BR1 efferent fibers project to any of the BR2.

We examined the laminar and columnar arrangement of projections from different layers of the BR1  to the BR2 in the cat.

Injections of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase were made into the anterior "genu" of the BR1 , where isoelevation contours of the BR2 layers are distorted due to the curvature of the nucleus.

Labeling from the A layers, which contain X and Y cells, was coextensive with layers 4 and 6 in both BR1 and BR2, as previously reported.

There was also labeling in layer 5a and layer 1 in both BR1 and BR2.

We found both differences and similarities in the spatiotemporal patterns of rod and cone development, which suggest the following: 1) Expression of opsin message  was found in a ventral patch of BR1 located nasal to the BR2.

The cone mosaic pattern was generated by a crystallization-like process initiated in the precocial ventral patch and secondarily in BR1, which then swept like a wave into BR2.

The accessory optic system of Rana pipiens consists of BR1  and a single terminal nucleus, BR2.

Labeled cells could still be observed along the BR1, but very few were observed within the rostral migratory stream or BR2.

BR1 influences on sizes and rapid plasticity of tactile receptive fields in the BR2.

The BR1 influences BR2 processing.

The present studies evaluated how loss of BR1 inputs affects sizes and plasticity of receptive fields in the BR2  when peripheral inputs were normal and when peripheral inputs were acutely disrupted.

Loss of BR1 inputs was produced by acute lesion of BR2, whereas disruption of peripheral inputs was produced by cutaneous microinjection of lidocaine .

Modest or no changes in sizes of BR1 receptive fields , comparable to changes during control periods of no treatment, were seen in response to BR2 lesion.

lidocaine also caused rapid RF enlargements after BR1 lesion, and these enlargements were greater than post- lidocaine enlargements when BR2 was intact.

These results indicate that normally sized receptive fields continue to be produced in the BR1 after loss of BR2 input.

BR1 is also not required for RF enlargements after lidocaine ; however, BR2 inputs have a constraining effect on these enlargements.

Both individual and sex differences in the volume of the BR1 and BR2 are determined primarily by incubation temperature, not by gonadal sex.

In the BR1, degenerating BR2 terminals synapsed on spiny dendrites which received convergent input from terminals containing peroxidase immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase, or from unlabeled terminals.

In the BR1, BR2 terminals labeled with immunoperoxidase for PHA-L were in synaptic contact with dendrites containing immunogold reaction product for tyrosine hydroxylase, or with unlabeled dendrites.

This study provides the first ultrastructural basis for multiple sites of cellular interaction between BR1 efferents and BR2 dopaminergic neurons.

Localization of corticotropin-releasing factor-like immunoreactivity in monkey BR1 and BR2.

Electrophysiological and anatomical observations suggest that terminals of BR1 mitral cells ending in rat BR2 exert certain postsynaptic effects via an excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter.

Morphology and kainate-receptor immunoreactivity of identified neurons within the BR1 projecting to BR2 in the cynomolgus monkey.

Projections of the BR1 to the BR2 are well known from the classical studies of Cajal  and Lorente de No .

Projections from the BR1 to BR2 are less well understood.

In the present study, a projection arising in layer V of the BR1 and terminating in a polymodal association area of the BR2 has been identified with the use of retrograde tracing.

Immunoreactivity for GluR 5/6/7 throughout the dendritic arbor of such neurons indicates that this class of glutamate receptor is in a position to play a prominent role in mediating excitatory neurotransmission within BR1-BR2 circuits.

In the present study the cytology and the topography of the cochlear granule cell domain (a comprehensive term introduced here for all granule cell-containing regions of the BR1) have been studied light microscopically in Nissl, Bielschowsky, and Golgi-Del Rio-Hortega material of cats, rats, and mice; in Golig rapid material of 0-14-day-old kittens; and in sections of 6-week-old kittens following HRP injections in the BR2 .

The silver, Golgi rapid, and HRP material suggest that all, or at least the majority, of the granule cell axons project to the molecular layer of the BR1 , forming parallel fibers similar to those of the BR2.

The border region between BR1 (field BR2 of Lorente de No, '34) is especially heavily stained.

BR1 is only lightly stained throughout much of the transverse extent of regio superior but there is also a conspicuous and constant patch of heavier staining at the border with the BR2.

We found that none of the tested viruses infected BR1 pyramidal neurons across synapses following inoculation into the BR2.

After injections of viruses into the BR1, we found labeling in commissurally projecting mossy cells and their afferent granule cells but not in BR2 pyramidal cells.

Serotoninergic, noradrenergic, and peptidergic innervation of BR1 of normal and transected BR2 of baboons .

The remaining BR1 and the nuclei interconnected with the BR2 displayed a lower level of innervation.

Immunoreactivity for nerve growth factor receptor was observed in cholinergic neurons of the BR1 but not in cholinergic neurons of the upper BR2.

The contribution of BR1 afferents to the cholinergic innervation of the human BR2 was therefore studied with the aid of nerve growth factor receptor -immunoreactive axonal staining.

These observations suggest that BR1 affiliated with BR2 and with the ascending reticular activating system are likely to be under particularly intense cholinergic influence.

The effects of partial BR1 lesions on activity and size of cells in the BR2.

The decrease in density from superficial to deep layers was more gradual in BR1 than in BR2.

In monkey BR1 , layer IVc presented a high concentration of neuropeptide Y binding sites, in addition to a dense zone of binding sites in layer I. Monkey BR2  displays a similar dense zone in layer I, but lacks such high density of neuropeptide Y binding sites in layer IV.

Histochemical evidence for the correlation between the ontogenetic increases in BR1 choline acetyltransferase activity and progressive mossy fiber innervation must await the application of the immunohistochemical method to the developing BR2.

BR1 terminals in the BR2 were labelled by anterograde axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase  after injecting the enzyme into one eye.

BR1 neurons were retrogradely labelled by horseradish peroxidase -injections into the dorsal cap of the BR2.

Segmental homologies among BR1 neurons in the BR2 of the zebrafish larva.

We described the morphology of 27 different types of BR1 neurons found in the BR2 5 days after fertilization.

A few cells were also located in the BR1 and in the BR2.

Injections of the anterograde tracer biocytin in these three BR1 resulted in fibre labelling in the BR2, consistent with the retrograde findings.

In the adult brain, Neph1 and Neph2 are predominantly seen in the olfactory nerve layer and the glomerular layer of the BR1, in the hippocampus, and in Purkinje cells of the BR2.

To a lesser extent, there is also synaptic localization of Neph1 within the BR1 and BR2 region on both pre- and postsynaptic sites.

The BR1 from Sprague-Dawley rats were processed using a Golgi technique that impregnated BR2 receptor neuron axons.

Localisation of mRNA encoding the protein precursor of galanin in the monkey BR1 and BR2.

The BR1 and BR2 sites of synthesis of preprogalanin mRNA were identified in three adult monkeys  by in situ hybridisation performed with a radiolabelled cRNA probe transcribed from human preprogalanin cDNA.

Moderate hybridisation was found in the BR1 and scattered hybridisation in the BR2.

The BR1 and the BR2 showed moderate to intense hybridisation in scattered cells.

There was little labelling in the BR1 but moderate labelling in the BR2.

Association fiber pathways to the BR1 from the BR2 in the rhesus monkey.

The projections to the BR1 that originate from the various areas of the BR2 of the rhesus monkey were investigated with the autoradiographic technique.

The BR1 fibers originating from the BR2 occupy the lower portion of the extreme capsule and lie just dorsal to the fibers of the uncinate fascicle.

EphB2, EphB5, and ephrin-B1 are expressed in BR1 neuropil and at the midline of the BR2 at E10-E12.

Galanin-like immunoreactive perikarya were seen in the BR1 and BR2.

The BR1  was examined ultrastructurally 3 or 21 days after complete deafferentation of the BR2  in ovariectomized adult female rats.

Immunoreactivity to somatostatin consisted of coarse fibre bundles that entered the BR1 and radiated dorsally to the BR2.

The distribution of immunoreactivity to met-enkephalin in the shovelnose ray was concentrated in the lateral third of the BR1 and to a lesser extent in the BR2.

Development of the projections from the BR1 to the BR2 in the cat.

The largest projection is to the BR1 and BR2  of the accessory optic system.

Axons also run forward to traverse the BR1 and to distribute to rostral portions of the BR2 in rat only.

Further, this projection also supplies input to the BR1, bilaterally in the rabbit and rat, and in the rabbit also to the BR2.

A fourth projection crosses the midline and courses caudally to reach, contralaterally, the BR1 and the above BR2.

The projections of the BR1 upon the BR2 in water snakes  and garter snakes.

Two BR1 send major projections to the BR2.

BR1 projects bilaterally to the BR2 along its full rostrocaudal extent.

BR1 may send a sparse projection to the BR2.

The climbing fiber inputs to Purkinje cells in zones 1 and 3 were derived from neurons in the ventrolateral outgrowth of the BR1, whereas those in zones 2 and 4 were derived from the BR2.

The results suggest that the Eph system in the BR1 may have a role in maintaining cell segregation during phases of BR2 development.

Y BR1 terminals contact interneurons in the cat BR2.

Far fewer cells were labeled by injections into the BR1 and/or BR2.

A small number of cells was retrogradely labeled by horseradish peroxidase injections into the vermal and BR1 or the BR2.

Thus, neurons around the BR1 contribute strongly to long ascending BR2 projections.

We have analyzed the connections between the BR1 and two major BR2 (i.e.

the BR1 and BR2) in which tactile input from peri-oral and other facial regions is a prominent feature.

Injections of either 3H-proline or horseradish peroxidase  into the BR1 reveal that trigeminocollicular axons reach the rostral two-thirds to three-quarters of the BR2, where they distribute in a nonuniform, patchy manner within layers IV-VI.

Data from a final set of retrograde tracing experiments show that the BR1 contains neurons which project to BR2.

Projection of individual axons from the BR1 to the BR2 in the cat.

Our purpose was to examine for the first time individual axon arbors from the BR1 that project to the BR2, describing their topography and nuclear and laminar targets.

The wedge-shaped internal nucleus composed of densely labeled calbindin D-28k + cells, separates the BR1 rostrally, and expands caudally to encapsulate the BR2.

The BR1 projects to multiple BR2.

One of the BR1 projection sites is the BR2.

Immunostaining for the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K  was used to identify the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K -poor sensorimotor and calcium binding protein calbindin-28K -rich associative BR1 regions and the corresponding calcium binding protein calbindin-28K -poor middle, calcium binding protein calbindin-28K -rich border, and the BR2 regions.

Cell counts revealed that the BR1 region contained a higher density of neurons and also a higher percentage of parvalbumin -positive neurons than the border and BR2 .

Approximately 40% of neurons in the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K -poor BR1 region project to the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K -poor part of the BR2.

Approximately 30% of the neurons in both the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K -rich border and the BR1 regions project to the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K -rich BR2 region.

It was estimated from the cell count data that most of the parvalbumin -negative neurons in all three regions of the BR1 project to the BR2.

The results indicate that the sensorimotor and associative territories of the BR1 have reciprocal projections between corresponding territories of the BR2 .

In muscoid flies, the BR1 is the last station in the BR2 for processing spectrally independent information from retinotopic afferents.

Morphologically small-field efferents form three classes according to the origin of their axons and their arborization in the BR1 and BR2.

The possible functional significance of small-field BR1 outputs onto descending neurons in the BR2 is discussed.

The ultrastructure and synaptic organization of the BR1 and BR2 of the teleost Chelon labrosus have been investigated.

The BR1 receives projections from the BR2.

In the BR1, the perikarya and smooth primary dendrites of the BR2 are interspersed among myelinated fibers and nerve boutons.

In wholemount BR1, immunoreactive cells were initially detected at the earliest stage of embryonic day 12 in a small circle termed "starting area" occupying the ventral part of the BR2.

At early stages of development , each cadherin is expressed in restricted regions of the BR1 wall of the BR2.

Closer examination using electron microscopy revealed that a significant number of BR1 astrocytes interpolated within the BR2 and established contact with the ventricle.

In addition, BR1, protuberant nests of cells, consisting primarily of neuroblasts, were found along the BR2 of MRL mice.

BR1 ganglion cells in fish and amphibians regenerate their axons after transection of the BR2.

Fiber tracing studies during the third month of regeneration show that the axons have reestablished a basically normal fiber order in the two brachia of the optic tract; axons originating in the BR1 are concentrated in the dorsal brachium, axons from the BR2 in the ventral brachium.

In order to evaluate whether regenerating axons are capable of navigating in the optic tract and brachia and on the BR1, the present study examined the pathway choices and the morphology of regenerating axons en route to their BR2 targets in goldfish.

After a survival time of 18 to 72 hours , the experimental animals were perfused with fixative and their right and left BR1 were dissected free and separated at the BR2.

Differences in the complexity of the growth cones of the regenerating axons (simple in the nerve and BR1 fiber layer, complex in the tract and the synaptic layer of the BR2) provide further evidence for specific interactions between the regenerating axons and their substrates along the pathway.

Tetraploid neurons in the BR1 and BR2 increased their arbor lengths predominantly by increasing the number of dendritic branches, while maintaining the average distance between branch points in the dendritic segments.

There are concomitant morphological and functional changes in the BR1 during the course of photoreceptor degeneration in a range of animal models of BR2 degeneration and in humans with eye disease.

These dendrites had a major transverse orientation and were quite long, many of them reaching well into the BR1 and into the BR2.

Cells classed as Type I had dendrites in lamina I and in the BR1 but lacked a significant projection into the BR2.

These BR1 inputs were less reliant on the BR2.

Laminar gradients of binding were observed that were specific for each radioligand; 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate sites were most dense in the inner molecular layer in all BR1, whereas 3H-flunitrazepam binding was generally most concentrated in the outer molecular layer and was least dense through all layers in the BR2.

The development of the rat BR1 was investigated with an antibody to the axonal membrane-specific phosphoprotein GAP-43 in order to examine the developmental pattern of afferent projections, and with cytochrome oxidase histochemistry and Nissl stains to reveal the morphogenesis of BR2.

On the first two days after birth, GAP-43 immunostaining in the BR1 was light and diffuse, then became intense in the presumptive layer IV of the BR2 on PND3 .

We argue that the disjunctive expression of GAP-43 in the barrel field reflects the pattern of distribution of afferents (most likely from the BR1) to the BR2, and that this pattern may be instructive in the formation of barrels as cytoarchitectonic units.

The 27-kDa heat shock protein  is constitutively expressed in many neurons of the BR1 and BR2, is strongly induced in glial cells in response to ischemia, seizures, or spreading depression, and is selectively induced in neurons after axotomy.

In addition, increases in Hsp27 immunoreactivity were detected in the BR1 and BR2.

Hyperthermia induced Hsp27 immunoreactivity in neurons of the BR1 and the BR2 within 3 hours and reached a maximum by 24 hours with a return to control levels 4-6 days after hyperthermia.

The BR1 projection the the rat with comments on visual pathways to the BR2.

The projection from the BR1 to the BR2 in the rat was studied with the technique of orthograde transport of labeled amino acids and autoradiography.

BR1 project ipsilaterally to BR2, respectively.

Nomenclature and location of avian BR1 and associated BR2.

Location of BR1 ganglion cells contributing to the early imprecision in the retinotopic order of the developing projection to the BR2 of the wallaby .

From 30 days onwards, the deposit of WGA-HRP resulted in a dense patch of retrogradely labelled BR1 ganglion cells that could be seen to be appropriately positioned in BR2.

Somewhat later, immunoreactive cells are detected in the BR1 and in the BR2, whereas the preoptic cell group is the last one to become tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive.

The maturation of catecholamine neuronal structures in the BR1 and BR2 circuitries, which takes place during development earlier in amphibians than in mammals, supports that notion.

The majority of neurotensin-immunoreactivity was found at the level of BR1, where it was densest in the trigeminal extension of the BR2.

In five kittens, a unilateral BR1 lesion was made on the day of birth, and horseradish peroxidase  was injected into the BR2 of both hemispheres when the animals were 10.5 to 13 months old.

For comparison, horseradish peroxidase was injected bilaterally into the BR1 of three cats 6.5 to 13.5 months after they received a similar unilateral BR2 lesion as adults.

Quantitative estimates indicate that the number of labeled cells is much larger than normal in the C layers of the BR1 ipsilateral to a neonatal BR2 lesion.

Both types of neurons receive synaptic contacts from the afferent axons that ascend from the BR1 and from those that descend from the BR2.

Cells projecting to dorsal  follicles were located in the most BR1, while those supplying ventral  follicles were restricted to the BR2.

The BR1 develops from cells on the rostrodorsal portion of the head and reaches its final position, BR2, as the cephalic flexure occurs and the jaws and mouth form.

The latter projection is similar to the diffuse BR1 projections of the BR2 in mammals.

These findings support previous suggestions that the BR1 is comparable to sensory regions of the mammalian BR2.

Although efferents from both regions formed both symmetric and asymmetric synapses, BR1 efferent terminals were statistically more likely to form asymmetric synapses than BR2 efferent terminals.

BR1 efferent terminals were more likely to contact adrenergic somata than were BR2 efferents, which usually contacted dendrites.

These findings 1) support the hypothesis that a portion of BR1 efferents to the BR2 may be involved in sympathoexcitatory, e.g.

This organization may have important functional properties with regard to a putative integration of different sensory modalities conveyed by BR1 afferent fibers to the BR2 .

Topographic and cytoarchitectonic organization of BR1 neurons related to their targets in low-, middle-, and high-frequency representations in cat BR2.

We studied the topographic organization of BR1 projections upon different ranges of BR2 frequency representation.

BR1 neurons were labeled by injecting horseradish peroxidase  or tritiated bovine serum albumin into BR2.

Injections in individual brains were confined to the same range of frequency representation, and distributed through three or four tonotopic BR1 in order to label as much of the BR2 projection upon a limited range of frequency representation as practicable.

The spatial organizations of arrays of labeled neurons are described, and each array is divided into a ventral division and BR1 (BR2), both composed mainly of small cells; and a medial division, composed mainly of medium and large cells.

The ventral and medial divisions (located BR1 , respectively), both contact the BR2 which is located rostrally.

The topographic organizations of the ventral division (and its tonotopic subdivision, the BR1), the BR2 , and the medial division are described.

In the BR1, the low-frequency area is located rostrally, and the high-frequency area is located caudally adjoining the high-frequency area in the BR2.

The topographic organizations of the BR1 and BR2 are consistent with tonotopic maps of these regions.

The earliest known marker for cells destined to form the BR1 is the orphan nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor 1 , which can be detected in the BR2 primordium by E11.

Most of these fibers appeared to end in the BR1 base, including the BR2.

The BR1 projections from the different DRGs appeared to overlap, and the same was true for the projections to the BR2.

Competition studies indicated that the Neuropeptide Y receptors located in the deep BR1 layers of the E21 or P1 rat BR2 exhibit Y2 receptor type characteristics.

BR1 projections and the degree of ocular segregation in the BR2 were examined by transneuronal autoradiography following unilateral intraocular injections of 3H-proline in a New World primate, the spider monkey .

The results show that, within the BR1 , BR2 fibers terminate in six principal layers and within the interlaminar spaces adjacent to the magnocellular layers, as well as the S layers ventral to the magnocellular layers.

Our main result shows that, in the BR1, BR2 projections terminate in well-defined ocular dominance columns in layer IV.

Unilateral iontophoretic deposition of horseradish peroxidase into the BR1 labeled ganglion cells bilaterally in the BR2.

Notable BR1 afferents included the dorsal lamina of the internal division of the BR2 ; the ipsilateral input was twice that of the contralateral projection.

The same region of the BR1 was also noted to be reciprocally connected to the BR2 .

The deafferented contralateral BR1 was defined electrophysiologically, and quantitative estimates of choline acetyltransferase -immunoreactive fiber density were obtained from the forelimb and hindlimb sectors of BR2 in both hemispheres.

In the BR1 forelimb sector contralateral to the deafferentation, a decrease in density of choline acetyltransferase -positive fibers relative to the ipsilateral hemisphere was apparent at 2 weeks and most pronounced at 13 weeks, involving all BR2 layers except layer I. There was no such decrease in the hindlimb sector, but the loss of choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity extended to sectors representing proximal forelimb and trunk.

From postmortem studies of eight human BR1 ranging in age from 11 to 35 weeks postconceptional age, we report that parvalbumin immunoreactivity is similarly plastic in human lower BR2 development, with many changes occurring prenatally.

The proportions of diverging neurons in the afferent projections to BR1, and to BR2 were about 10%.

Diverging neurons were also found in the projections of the BR1 to the BR2.

However, the immunoreactivities were observed in the accessory optic tract, fasciculus retroflexus, solitary tract, and primary afferent fibers in the superficial layers of the BR1 and BR2.

Aldosterone-sensitive neurons in the BR1: bidirectional connections with the BR2.

A prior retrograde tracing study revealed only a minor projection from the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing neurons directly to the BR1 , but these experiments suggested that a more substantial projection may be relayed through the BR2.

Small injections of cholera toxin beta subunit  into the BR1  produced both retrograde cell body labeling in the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing neurons and anterograde axonal labeling in the BR2 .

Complementary cholera toxin beta subunit injections, centered in the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing subregion of the BR1 , retrogradely labeled neurons in the BR2 .

The 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing neurons may represent one of the functional inputs to the BR1 , and their activity may be modulated by a return projection from the BR2 .

The laminar origin of BR1 projections to the BR2 was studied in 17 adult rhesus monkeys with the use of the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase .

Despite the fact that different regions of the BR1 were injected in separate animals, the majority of the BR2 containing retrogradely filled neurons remained the same.

No consistent differences were noted in the location of labeled neurons in either BR1 or BR2 sites after dorsal vs. ventral injections or caudal vs. rostral injection sites.

Electron microscopic studies confirmed the presence of mGluR7a in axon terminals in both the BR1 and the BR2 and also revealed the presence of mGluR7a at postsynaptic sites in both of these regions.

BR1 ganglion cells were studied in pigmented ferrets that received small electrophoretic injections of horseradish peroxidase  into the BR2  or optic tract.

To determine whether any neurons that express the c-fos protein in response to noxious stimulation project to supraspinal sites, we combined the immunocytochemical localization of c-fos with the localization of a retrogradely transported protein-gold complex that was injected into the BR1 and BR2 targets of the major ascending spinal pathways.

Distribution of the major gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunits in the BR1 and associated BR2 of the adult rat.

Using immunocytochemistry, we investigated the distribution of 12 major gamma-aminobutyric acid  receptor subunits  in the BR1 and BR2 of the rat.

In the BR1 and in the BR2, numerous presumptive dopaminergic neurons were labeled for subunits alpha3, gamma3, and/or delta.

This highly heterogeneous distribution of individual gamma-aminobutyric acid  receptor subunits suggests the existence of differently assembled, and presumably also functionally different, gamma-aminobutyric acid  receptors within individual nuclei of the BR1 and BR2.

BR1 projections to the normal and noradrenergically hyperinnervated BR2.

The motor nucleus also receives an extensive bilateral input from the BR1 and BR2.

Smaller, BR1 neurons were concentrated rostrally and ipsilaterally in the BR2.

Connection from BR1 to BR2 in macaque monkey.

In terms of their type, laminar location, number, and targets, the synapses that formed the BR1 projection to BR2 are typical of a major, excitatory, feedforward projection of macaque visual cortex.

Efferent projections from BR1 of the temporal pole to the BR2 in the rhesus monkey.

The efferent projection from the BR1 to the BR2  was studied in the rhesus monkey .

They make up the largest part of the temporal tip and separate the BR1 from the architecturally more progressive isocortical divisions of the pole found laterally at the rostral ends of the BR2.

Intracortical injections restricted to BR1 did not result in either anterograde or retrograde transport of label to BR2 .

In normal rats the crossed parabigeminotectal projection is restricted to the superficial layers in BR1, regions innervated also by the lower temporal portion of the BR2.

In unilaterally enucleated animals the crossed parabigeminotectal projection to the "denervated" BR1 is expanded, as is the BR2 projection from the ipsilateral eye.

In addition, there is a crossed BR1 projection to the "denervated" BR2 in these rats.

The existence of an expanded parabigeminotectal projection in bilaterally enucleated rats shows that a sustained ipsilateral retinotectal projection is not necessary for the establishment of a crossed parabigeminotectal projection, but points to the possibility that BR1 input may constrain the BR2 projection to terminate within certain boundaries.

Cholinergic axons in the rat BR1 synapse preferentially onto BR2 dopamine neurons.

These findings suggest that cholinergic inputs to the BR1 synaptic actions, with a major portion of this effect likely to involve an excitatory influence on dopamine BR2 neurons.

As such, the results suggest that natural and drug rewards operating through cholinergic afferents to the BR1 have a direct synaptic link to the BR2 dopamine neurons that modulate approach behaviors.

Second, the inner small-celled region is a group of small cells located between the external BR1 lamina  and the medial margin of the ventral regions of the main body of the BR2: the inner small-celled region is clearly differentiated in cats only.

We suggest that the inner small-celled region may constitute a previously undescribed dorsal extension of the BR1, rather than a subdivision of the BR2.

Each glomerulus consists of the highly branched neuritic arbors of both BR1 axons and BR2 neurons, bounded by a nearly complete envelope of glial cells.

Labeled BR1 neurons at the level of the decussation of the corticospinal tract were most numerous after tracer injections into the BR2.

The main projections from the BR1 involved motoneurons in the BR2 that supply abdominal wall and cremaster muscles.

BR1 projections, especially those involving the BR2, were sexually dimorphic, being more extensive in males than in females.

This study determined which elements in BR1 serve as the postsynaptic targets of the gracile projection and whether these elements also receive input from the BR2.

This termination pattern contrasts markedly with that of other somatosensory inputs to the BR1 and may account for the greater heterogeneity in responses to somatosensory stimuli displayed by neurons in BR2 .

The most likely source of these inhibitory synapses is the BR1, a structure that has been shown by others to receive input from the BR2.

Axons that form the adult uncrossed retinofugal projection arise from the temporal crescent of the BR1 and reach the BR2 on postnatal day 7.

The abrupt divergence of the uncrossed fibres occurs at a border between two glial cell types: the interfascicular glia that characterise the main part of the BR1 and the radial glia of the BR2 part of the nerve.

BR1 pigment epithelial correlates of avian BR2 degeneration: electron microscopic analysis.

In order to investigate the expression of cell adhesion molecules in synapses, we have studied the localization of the neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM in the BR1 and BR2 of adult mice by immunocytological and immunochemical methods.

N-CAM 180 does not appear to be differentially expressed in synapses of a particular morphological type, but is detectable in all types of synapses in the BR1 and BR2, except for mossy fiber synapses and synapses between basket and Purkinje cells, which are generally N-CAM 180-negative.

Catecholamine-containing neurons in the sheep BR1 and BR2: immunohistochemical study with tyrosine hydroxylase  and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase  antibodies.

The present study describes the distribution and morphological characteristics of neurons and nerve fibers containing the catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, in the sheep BR1 and BR2 on the basis of immunohistochemical procedures.

Twenty-four to 48 hours after the nerves innervating different vibrissae were exposed to horseradish peroxidase , the trigeminal ganglia, BR1, and BR2 were fixed by perfusion and serial sections were processed according to the tetramethylbenzidine technique.

The posterior vertical row is represented most superficially in the BR1, but most deeply in the BR2.

Microinjections of horseradish peroxidase were made in different mediolateral positions along the width of the BR1 and BR2.

the border between the BR1 and BR2, a different pattern of labeled cells is seen.

Histochemical characterization of a BR1 projection of the BR2 in the squirrel monkey.

Histochemical evidence is presented for a catecholamine-containing projection from the BR1 to the BR2 in the squirrel monkey.

After injection of horseradish peroxidase into the BR1, labelled cell bodies are localized throughout the major portions of the BR2.

Conversely, after microinjection into the BR1, tritiated proline is transported into the BR2 where it appears within fibers similar in distribution to those revealed by fluorescence histochemistry.

Both transport techniques indicate that BR1 projections of the BR2 originate from both ipsilateral and contralateral nuclei.

In this investigation, BR1 and extended BR2 outputs were compared by using retrograde tracing in adult and postnatal rats.

Few neurons projecting from the BR1 to the BR2 were observed even at postnatal day 21.

All of the labeled neurons belonged to the BR1 system, and no BR2 neurons were labeled.

Several laboratories routinely reconstruct BR1 and BR2 dendrites to correlate their three-dimensional structure with biophysical, electrophysiological, and anatomical observables.

A consistent fraction of parameters  was significantly different between BR1 and BR2 cells.

BR1 and BR2 neurons could be distinguished by global quantities such as branch order and Sholl distance.

In the mustached bat, we have discovered a population of such FM selective cells in an area interposed between the BR1  and the BR2 .

To describe FM selectivity of neurons in the BR1 and to compare it to other midbrain BR2, up- and down-sweeping linear FM stimuli were presented at different modulation rates.

The main targets of anterograde transport were the deep layers of the BR1 and the BR2.

Sex differences were detected in most BR1 with this sample size; the exception was the BR2.

Topography of projections from the BR1 to the BR2 in the rat.

We examined the organization of descending projections from auditory and adjacent BR1 to the BR2  in the rat by using the retrograde and anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase.

On the basis of the resulting pattern of retrogradely labeled neurons in the BR1, different BR2 and fields were defined.

Corticopontine remodelling after BR1 and/or BR2 lesions in newborn rats.

In contrast, the absence of sensorimotor corticopontineBR1SMP) plasticity after BR2 lesions, and vice versa, demonstrates the absence of plasticity between pathways which differ anatomically and functionally.

The projections from the BR1 and the BR2 (N.r.t.

onto the BR1, uvula, and the BR2 were studied with retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase n the rhesus monkey.

The BR1 appears to receive a substantial projection from the BR2.

The BR1 receives a bilateral projection  from BR2.

The number of labeled cells in the BR1 was 13% of the number in the BR2.

Fibers from the BR1 only reach the region of the BR2.

Altered development of BR1 projections following neonatal BR2 ablation in the hamster.

From the earliest ages, BR1 axons innervate the BR2 in regions specific to their adult projection zones and show progressive growth within these zones.

Within the retroorbital and retroocular connective tissue, the fibers redistribute to become associated with sensory-nerve branches of the BR1, the orbital vasculature, and the BR2 sheath.

Fibers reach their targets by traversing variable amounts of connective tissue of the BR1, the BR2, and the striated muscle epimysia.

These fibers travel independent of the BR1, but, otherwise, they use the same BR2 pathways as those employed in the intact animal.

Anatomical organization of the BR1 (BR2) of the cat.

Golgi and axonal transport techniques have been used to examine the organization of neurons within BR1, BR2, of the cat.

This organization has been compared to that of the primate BR1 as described in previous studies and it is discussed in relationship to the distribution of afferents from the BR2 .

However, lamina 4B in the monkey, which contains spiny stellate neurons but does not receive direct input from the BR1 , has no direct counterpart in cat BR2.

The BR1 continues to add new ganglion cells peripherally, but there is no neurogenesis in the BR2.

To maintain retinotopy in postmetamorphic frogs, the terminals of the BR1 axons must continually shift toward the BR2.

We tested the proposal of centripetally shifting axons by making punctate injections of horseradish peroxidase  in the BR1 of adult Rana pipiens and observing the patterns of filled cells in the BR2, as was done in the goldfish .

As the BR1 site moves from rostral to caudal, this band of cells should move, pendulum-like, from temporal to nasal BR2.

Dorsally directed dendrites of both external urethral sphincter and external anal sphincter motoneurones coursed in lamina VII toward the BR1, and dendrites of external anal sphincter motoneurones further extended toward the BR2.

BR1 projections to the superficial layers of BR2 in the tree shrew.

Our recent studies of tree shrew BR1 have focused on the organization of BR2 projections to layer IV and the projections from IV to layer III.

BR1 neurons were studied extensively, particularly in regions that are difficult to routinely stain with Golgi impregnations, including the BR2.

When Purkinje cells were deprived of their climbing fiber innervation by BR1 pedunculotomy or by transplantation of BR2 anlagen into the anterior eye chamber, the subsequent patterning of INT beta 1-positive Purkinje cells was not changed.

Distinct neurochemical populations in the rat BR1 and BR2: evidence for their selective activation by interleukin-1beta.

The BR1  and the BR2  have been linked closely anatomically and functionally.

Although there was a similar overlap in the distribution of neurotensin with enkephalin in the BR1 and BR2 , it was observed that corticotropin-releasing hormone and enkephalin rarely were colocalized in either nucleus.

a stimulus that results in a robust increase in c-fos mRNA expression in the BR1 and BR2 .

Furthermore, these data indicate that intraperitoneal interleukin-1beta recruits neurochemically distinct pathways within the BR1 and BR2 , and it is suggested that this differential activation may mediate specific aspects of immune, limbic, and/or autonomic processes.

Both the BR1 and the BR2 have the same cell components and glomeruli.

Lesions of the BR1 produced degenerating terminals bilaterally in glomeruli in the BR2 .

Following the destruction of the BR1, degenerating terminals occurred in the BR2.

Both small and large cells in the BR1 were labeled after horseradish peroxidase injections into the BR2.

Alpha- and gamma-motoneurons in the adult human BR1 and BR2: the significance of dendroachitectonics studied by the Golgi method.

Examination of the motor columns in the BR1 intumescences and of the third and twelfth BR2 revealed four neuron types, based on dendritic field size and dendritic branching pattern.

Of the two types of gamma-motoneurons recognized in the BR1 and BR2, one was a miniature version of the commoner type of alpha-motoneuron.

An analysis of the relative density of label in the molecular layer of the BR1 suggests that the density of the commissural projection from BR2 is much greater in the rat and cat than in the guinea pig or rabbit.

This pattern of projections suggests that BR1 contains a number of visual subdivisions in addition to BR2.

Contralateral projections were to BR1 and BR2.

Label in BR1 was concentrated in layers I, III, and VI whereas other BR2 were most densely labeled in the granular and supragranular layers.

The projection pattern to the BR1 suggests that BR2 projects in a topographic manner to two subdivisions within each of these structures.

The projections to BR1 clearly distinguish the bordering cortex from BR2.

BR1 targets were generally similar to those seen after BR2 injections, although additional projections were observed depending on the location of the injection.

Thus, some of the BR1 and BR2 subdivisions described for monkeys appear to exist in prosimians.

BR1 connections of the BR2 in the normal mouse: a study based on anterograde and retrograde methods.

BR1 connections are widely distributed through the BR2 in the mouse.

Further, superficial focal lesions in BR1 which receive BR2 connections give rise only to homotopic contralateral degeneration.

BR1 give rise to no BR2 connections.

The cells of origin of BR1 connections are located at all laminar levels of the BR2 and include pyramidal and polymorphic cells but not the granule cells of layer IV.

In the BR1, labeling was most prominent in the BR2, motoneurons, and nuclei containing preganglionic autonomic neurons.

Electron microscopic studies of the BR1 and BR2 showed staining that was restricted mainly to postsynaptic densities and associated dendritic and cell body cytoplasm.

Subsynaptic dense bodies  were associated with some stained postsynaptic densities in both the BR1 and BR2.

Presence of the decapeptide in the BR1 prior to appearance of beta-luteinizing hormone in the BR2 suggests a possible role for luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone in this system on maturation of the gonadotropes and differentiation of the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis.

To determine the distribution of terminating fibres in BR1 , iontophoretic injections of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin were delivered into distinct areas of the BR2.

Neurons of the BR1 projected mainly to the BR2, which contained parvicellular neuroendocrine cells.

Finally, all areas of the BR1 contributed substantially to fibres terminating in the perinuclear shell of the BR2 .

Efferent projections of the BR1 to BR2 dendrites in rat brain: evidence for a monosynaptic pathway.

Therefore, we combined peroxidase labeling of biotinylated dextran amine  or Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin  from the BR1 with gold-silver labeling for tyrosine hydroxylase  in the BR2.

Injections placed into neighboring nuclei (BR1, BR2) served as controls.

Only injections centered in the BR1 produced anterograde labeling in BR2 containing tyrosine hydroxylase processes.

Approximately 19% of the biotinylated dextran amine and Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin axon terminals examined originating from the commissural portion of the BR1 formed synaptic specializations with dendrites exhibiting tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the BR2 .

Alterations in calretinin immunostaining in the ferret BR1 after BR2 ablation.

In this study, we used image analysis to assess changes in calretinin immunoreactivity in the BR1 in ferrets 2 months after unilateral BR2 ablations at 30-40 days of age, soon after hearing onset.

In addition, the level of calretinin immunostaining ipsilaterally within neurons in the BR1 was significantly less in BR2 ablated than control animals.

Thus, BR1-driven activity appears to affect calcium binding protein levels in both neuropil and neurons within the BR2.

The BR1 are located in the BR2 in and around the median longitudinal fasciculi .

There was a higher proportion of lateral cells that innervated the BR1 and the BR2 while the dorsal cells tended to innervate the other organs.

Motoneurons that innervate the accessory lateral rectus muscle comprised a group of large cells located approximately 0.5 mm ventral to the rostral portion of the BR1, corresponding to the BR2 .

After transection of the BR1 of adult rats, most of the axons in the proximal stump die and the surviving ones are unable to regenerate into the BR2.

Patterns of cell death in mouse BR1 neurons after unilateral BR2 removal.

A punctate immunolabel was detected on somatic membranes of granule and stellate cell interneurons in both the BR1 and the BR2.

One of the BR1, BR2 , was examined in Golgi-stained tissue sections from the left and right hemispheres of male and female canaries.

Distribution and morphology of BR1 commissural neurons within the BR2 of normal and reeler mice.

Retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase was used to examine the cells of origin of the BR1 commissural fibers  in the BR2 of normal and reeler mice.

In the reeler mutant, CC neurons are found in all BR1 layers, but two-thirds are situated in the lower half of the BR2.

Reflexes at the lower levels provide rapid visceral and somatic reactions to threatening stimuli, while the BR1 and BR2 coordinate these to produce more concerted responses.

In particular, no evidence exists of direct connections between auditory and vocal motor pathways, and two newly identified centers for auditory processing, BR1  and BR2 , have no documented place among known auditory circuits.

Fetal day 77-135 monkeys all have a distribution and density of BR1 S cones similar to adults, although the high-density ring is not obvious in fetal BR2.

Distinct cell groups in the BR1 of the cat project to different areas in the BR2.

Especially for the latter two functions, BR1 afferents from the BR2 are of vital importance because, in addition to information regarding homeostasis and thermoregulation, they convey information from the pelvic viscera and sex organs.

In the present retro- and antero-grade tracing study, the projection patterns of different BR1 cell groups in the BR2 were determined.

The first and largest group was present in BR1-BR2  and consisted of small, oval, and fusiform neurons.

The main BR1 target of the first group was the BR2 .

This group projected strongly to a distinct region in the BR1 and the laterally adjacent BR2.

Interruption of the BR1 near the BR2 results in degeneration of all efferent terminals on outer hair cells.

The ultrastructure and synaptic connections of the spinal terminations from single, physiologically characterized axons descending in the BR1 from the midline, BR2.

The BR1 showed a sixfold decrease in mGluR5 with development, whereas the BR2 showed only a threefold decrease.

Immunohistochemical localization of GAD67-expressing neurons and processes in the rat BR1: subregional distribution in the BR2.

The role of gamma-aminobutyric acid  in homeostatic control in the BR1, in particular, in the BR2 , is well established.

The goal of the current study was to reexamine the efficacy of immunohistochemical localization of glutamic acid decarboxylase  protein, specifically the 67-kDa isoform , as a marker for gamma-aminobutyric acid ergic neurons in the BR1 and to provide a detailed map of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67-immunoreactive  cells within rat BR2 by using a recently developed mouse monoclonal antibody.

this issue), and rubroolivary neurons were labeled retrogradely first with Fast Blue injected either into the BR1 or the BR2.

Glutaeus axons were dispersed widely through BR1 but loosely gathered together in one quadrant of the sciatic nerve after passing through the BR2.

Correlative distribution of catecholamine varicosities and magnocellular neurosecretory neurons in the rat BR1 and BR2.

The major catecholamine innervation to the BR1 and BR2 did not coexist with the major distribution of magnocellular perikarya, but was located peripheral to the nuclei.

The BR1 projection of the BR2  was studied in the cat with the autoradiographic and horseradish peroxidase  methods.

This BR1 field is denoted the BR2 , consonant with previous nomenclature in the rat .

A light input to superficial layer 1 of BR1 probably also arises from BR2 , and there may be an input to layers 5 and 6.

All portions of BR1 alpha appear to project to the BR2.

The organization of the efferent projections from the BR1 to the BR2: a Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin  study in the rat.

Deeper laminae of the BR1 contain moderate immunocytochemical labeling, but the BR2 is only sparsely stained.

Previous analysis of developing BR1 has shown widespread, dense NT75 labeling throughout the BR2 in the early postnatal period, which later becomes restricted to the adult pattern.

Histological examination of BR1 revealed no striking abnormalities other than the loss of BR2 Purkinje cells.

Projections from the BR1 to the BR2: a light and electron microscopic PHA-L study in the rat.

A recent study, carried out in the monkey BR1 demonstrated a hitherto undescribed projection from the lateral to the BR2.

Injections of the lectin tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin  were placed into several levels of the BR1 and the distribution of fibers in the BR2 was evaluated.

In general, the heaviest labeling of the BR1 was observed after injections at BR2, especially when the injection was located ventrally.

Injections placed caudally in the BR1 resulted in light to medium levels of labeled fibers in the BR2; the terminal field in these cases did not extend as far rostrally as after the rostral and midlevel injections.

The BR1 terminate in the BR2.

After injection of tritiated gamma-aminobutyric acid  into the pigeon BR1 and BR2 it was possible to correlate certain aspects of the autoradiographic labeling pattern with observations made from Golgi material.

The first system derives from cell bodies within sublayer IIi the axons of which could be selectively labelled throughout their course within layer I and to the areas of termination within the BR1 and BR2.

The radially ascending dendrites and axon collaterals of these neurons arbourised within sublayer IIf, and could be labelled in a retrograde fashion after BR1 or BR2 injections.

The biochemical and anatomical implications of specific gamma-aminobutyric acid uptake and subsequent transport of label are discussed and a model of the BR1, based on the three proposed inhibitory systems and their relation to a number of BR2 afferent inputs, considered.

The reeler mutation alters the radial but not the tangential structure of the BR1, suggesting that these two aspects of BR2 organization develop under the control of independent mechanisms.

Ameboid microglia thus appear in the BR1 11 days prior to the onset of axon loss in the optic nerve  and 14 days prior to the beginning of the period of reduction of BR2 ganglion cell numbers .

The organization of backward projections from the BR1  to the BR2  was studied in the macaque monkey by using the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin .

The objectives of the study were to investigate this backward projection and to compare it with 1) the backward projections that have been described previously in the early sensory areas and 2) the forward projection from BR1 to BR2.

Nine single axons projecting from BR1 to BR2 were reconstructed through serial sections.

The size of the individual arbors of these axons along their long axes tended to be larger  than those of BR1-to-BR2 forward axons .

Thus, the authors conclude that, like other backward systems described to date, those from BR1 to BR2 are divergent.

Comparisons to the BR1 of other reptiles are made, homologies to ectostriatial regions of the bird are proposed, and the findings are discussed in relation to BR2 organization of other vertebrates.

The present study examined survival- and growth-enhancing effects of BR1 cells on BR2 cholinergic neurons  in culture and the degree to which endogenous nerve growth factor , brain-derived neurotrophic factor , and neurotrophin-3  contribute to those trophic effects.

When fetal  basal forebrain  cells were grown for 5 days in coculture with BR1 neurons, staining for acetylcholinesterase  showed a threefold increase in the number of BFCNs relative to BF cultures without BR2.

We focused on two prominent sites of embryonic RA signaling: the BR1 and the BR2.

In the BR1, DR5-RARE transgene-expressing neurons are seen in the mature granule cell and periglomerular layers, as well as in cells in the BR2-the established source for newly generated granule and periglomerular neurons.

Some of these cells--particularly those in the BR1 and BR2--are found in central nervous system regions that receive local RA signals early in development, and retain a significant amount of functional or structural plasticity in the adult.

Distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase-containing neurons and fibers in the BR1 of the budgerigar : general patterns and labeling in BR2.

TN-GnRH cells, which are located in the transitional area between the BR1 and the BR2, showed strong sGnRH and weaker cGnRH-II immunoreactivity.

TN-GnRH cells projected to wide areas of the central nervous system from the BR1 to the BR2.

The second group, located in the BR1, showed only sGnRH immunoreactivity and projected only to the BR2.

This cell group projected mainly to brain regions posterior to the BR1 and the BR2.

At the electron microscopic level, most immunopositive terminals in BR1 and BR2 displayed morphological characteristics of endings of myelinated primary afferents.

There were several differences between RGS10-LIR distributions in rat and mouse, the most striking of which were the far denser immunoreactivity in rat BR1 and BR2.

Dual-labeling histochemistry in BR1 demonstrated that densely labeled BR2 cells were biased to the indirect-projecting output pathway.

ChAT+ fibers appeared to be rather evenly distributed throughout all layers of the BR1, but a subtle laminar pattern was evident in the BR2, where lower concentrations of fibers in layer IV contrasted with higher concentrations in layer V. Electron microscopy demonstrated that immunoreaction product was concentrated in synaptic vesicle-filled profiles and that many of these structures formed synaptic contacts.

Newly revealed is the extensive connectivity between the BR1  and BR2.

BR1 to BR2) were not confirmed.

Dopamine  influences a number of cognitive and motor functions that are mediated by the primate BR1, and the DA membrane transporter  is known to be a critical regulator of DA neurotransmission in BR2 structures in rodents.

To gain insight into the possible functional role of BR1 DAT, we compared the regional, laminar, and ultrastructural distribution of DAT immunoreactivity to that of tyrosine hydroxylase , the rate-limiting enzyme in DA synthesis, in the BR2 of macaque monkeys.

BR1, BR2) not previously thought to receive a substantial DA input.

For example, in contrast to TH, DAT immunoreactivity in the BR1 was localized predominantly to small-diameter profiles, whereas, in the BR2, DAT and TH immunoreactivities were present in both large-diameter and small-diameter profiles, which may represent varicose and intervaricose axon segments, respectively.

In particular, these observations reveal an anatomical substrate for a direct and potent influence of DA over neuronal activity in BR1 and in certain regions of the BR2.

Moreover, this distribution of DAT suggests that BR1 DA fibers may permit greater neurotransmitter diffusion than BR2 DA axons.

ChAT-ir cells were restricted to the BR1, but AChE-positive neurons were observed throughout the whole extension of the lamination except in the BR2.

The isthmic region showed abundant AChE-positive and ChAT-ir cells in the isthmic, secondary gustatory and BR1 and in the BR2.

The peripheral axons also degenerated and this fiber loss exhibited selective topographies that paralleled the cell loss within the BR1, although this phenomenon was more prominent in the proximal part of the osseous spiral lamina near the ganglion and less obvious more distally near the BR2.

Glycine endings predominated in the BR1, while GLY/GABA endings were prevalent in the BR2.

This research shows that the BR1-BR2  of the gerbil contains a sexually dimorphic area  whose morphology is influenced by adult gonadal steroids.

Coronal sections through the BR1-BR2 were stained with thionin to visualize the SDA.
