Thus the dorsomedial part of the subthalamic nucleus(STh) is connected with the subcommisural ventral pallidum, whereas a more ventral and lateral part of the medial subthalamic nucleus(STh) is related to the medial globus pallidus
The lateral hypothalamic area, directly adjacent to the subthalamic nucleus(STh), containing neurons with a morphology quite similar to those in the subthalamic nucleus(STh), projects to parts of the ventral pallidum related to the olfactory tubercle
The medial subthalamic nucleus(STh) sends strong projections to the medial part of the entopeduncular nucleus and the adjacent lateral hypothalamic area
Sparser projections from the medial subthalamic nucleus(STh) reach the rostral and medial part of the caudate-putamen and the nucleus accumbens
