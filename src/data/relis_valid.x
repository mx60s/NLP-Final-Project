Viewed broadly , BR1 posterior division cell groups share massive , topographically organized , bidirectional connections with the BR2 and other amygdalar components of the accessory olfactory system ( Dong et al , 2001a ; Dong and Swanson , 2004b ) , and they send massive , topographic projections to components of the hypothalamic behavior control column that are associated with the two basic classes of social behavior : reproductive and defensive ( Dong and Swanson , 2004b ) .
In contrast , the BR1 anterolateral group receives massive inputs from the BR2 and main olfactory system components of the amygdala ( Dong et al , 2001a ) and sends dense projections to the central autonomic control network , to midbrain structures positioned to modulate the expression of orofacial and locomotor somatomotor responses , and to regions of the ventral striatopallidal system associated with these midbrain struc- BSTdm PROJECTIONS tures ( Dong et al , 2000 , 2001b , 2003 , 2004a ) .
Finally , many axons from the BR1 injection site extend caudally into the BR2 posterior division , where moderate numbers of fibers with boutons are observed in the interfascicular nucleus and ventral region of the transverse nucleus ; the principal nucleus contains only scattered fibers ( Fig 4J ) .
Dorsal to the anterior commissure , a few BR1 axons leave the BST to enter the BR2 directly ( Fig 4DG ) .
Many rostrally directed fibers from the BR1 also extend directly into the BR2 .
Rostrally directed BR1 axons thus provide major inputs to two regions : the BR2 and lateral septal nucleus .
Rostrally directed BR1 axons thus provide major inputs to two regions : the nucleus accumbens and BR2 .
Only a few axons from the BR1 injection site follow the BR2 to the amygdalar region ( Figs 3 , 4KS ) .
Most PHAL-labeled BR1 axons reach the amygdalar region through the ventrally directed BR2 ( Fig 3 ) .
In the BST anterior division , the BR1 moderately to densely innervates the BR2 and caudoventral region of the anterolateral area and the fusiform , rhomboid , and ventral nuclei , whereas the rostral two-thirds of the anterolateral area and the caudodorsal end of the anteromedial area , along with the oval and juxtacapsular nuclei , receive only sparse inputs at best In the BST posterior division , only the interfascicular nucleus and ventral regions of the transverse nucleus receive significant inputs from the BSTdm
The largest pathway from the BR1 injection site extends ventrally through the magnocellular and ventral nuclei to the medial and lateral preoptic areas and adjacent dorsomedial region of the BR2 ( Figs 4HJ , 5C ) .
BR1 projections to BR2 .
Descending BR1 axons follow the periventricular , ventral , and lateral BR2 , and the medial forebrain bundle , to the medially subjacent hypothalamus .
Some axons in the BR1 extend into the BR2 , whereas axons remaining in the caudal hypothalamus continue on to the midbrain and hindbrain .
The pattern of BR1 inputs to the BR2 is exceptionally complex and is unique .
Based on our collection of over 200 PHAL experiments , the densest BR1 input to the paraventricular magnocellular neuroendocrine division arises in the BR2 .
As mentioned above , abundant PHAL-labeled BR1 axons enter the BR2 and join the ventral propriohypothalamic pathway as defined by Thompson and Swanson ( 2003 ; Fig 4H , I ) .
Many PHAL-labeled axons from the BR1 injection site course through dorsal regions of the BR2 , medial regions of the lateral preoptic area , and anterior region of the lateral hypothalamic area to join the medial forebrain bundle ( Figs 4HK , 5C ) .
Many PHAL-labeled axons from the BR1 injection site course through dorsal regions of the substantia innominata , medial regions of the BR2 , and anterior region of the lateral hypothalamic area to join the medial forebrain bundle ( Figs 4HK , 5C ) .

Just caudal to the paraventricular nucleus , BR1 fibers generate an extremely dense terminal plexus in the suprafornical region of the BR2 , between the zona incerta and fornix ( Figs 4PR , 9A ) .
BR1 inputs to BR2 .
In contrast to other parts of the BST , the BR1 sends an obvious group of axons through the stria medullaris to the BR2 ( Fig 3 ) .
Contralateral projections As described above , projections from BR1 to midline brain structures ( such as the BR2 , subfornical organ , retrochiasmatic area , midline thalamic nuclei , and raphe nuclei ) are bilateral , with an ipsilateral predominance .
Contralateral projections As described above , projections from BR1 to midline brain structures ( such as the median preoptic nucleus , BR2 , retrochiasmatic area , midline thalamic nuclei , and raphe nuclei ) are bilateral , with an ipsilateral predominance .
Contralateral projections As described above , projections from BR1 to midline brain structures ( such as the median preoptic nucleus , subfornical organ , BR2 , midline thalamic nuclei , and raphe nuclei ) are bilateral , with an ipsilateral predominance .
From the BR1 , substantial numbers of axons enter the contralateral BR2 ( Fig 4V , W ) and follow the dorsal periventricular system toward the pontine central gray .
The overall projections of the BR1 , based on PHAL analysis , have been described previously ( Simerly and Swanson , 1988 ; Thompson and Swanson , 2003 ) ; here , clear differences with the BR2 are emphasized .
First , it is important to note that the BR1 receives little input from the BR2/amygdalar region ( Simerly et al , 1984 ; Dong et al , 2001a ) and does not project significantly to the central amygdalar nucleus ( see Thompson and Swanson , 2003 ) , which receives a clear input from the BSTdm , and all other components of the BST anterior division ( Dong et al , 2000 , 2001b ; Dong and Swanson , 2003 , 2004a , 2005a , b ) .
Second , compared with the BSTdm , the BR1 projects more substantially to the BR2 , which is particularly obvious in the LSr . m . v . c .
First , in the hypothalamus , the BR1 sends very dense projections to the medial part of the BR2 , arcuate nucleus , and posterior region of the periventricular nucleus but almost none to the median preoptic nucleus and descending division of the paraventricular nucleus .
First , in the hypothalamus , the BR1 sends very dense projections to the medial part of the medial preoptic nucleus , arcuate nucleus , and posterior region of the periventricular nucleus but almost none to the BR2 and descending division of the paraventricular nucleus .
Second , in the lower brainstem , the BR1 provides only light inputs to the retrorubral area and other regions of the BR2 and to Barringtons nucleus , and almost no inputs to the medullary components of the raphe and reticular nuclei , which receive obvious inputs from the BSTdm .
Second , in the lower brainstem , the BR1 provides only light inputs to the retrorubral area and other regions of the midbrain reticular nucleus and to Barringtons nucleus , and almost no inputs to the medullary components of the raphe and reticular nuclei , which receive obvious inputs from the BR2 .
The PHAL evidence suggests that the overall projection pattern of the BR1 is essen- 100 tially a subset of that generated by the BR2 ( see also Table 1 of Dong and Swanson 2005b ) .
In contrast , the BR1 projections to the BR2 are found caudally and ventrally , where vasopressinergic neuronal cell bodies predominate , as well as rostrally and dorsally , where oxytocinergic cell bodies predominate .
The BR1 also densely innervates several clusters of magnocellular neurons forming part of the accessory BR2 , where complex mixtures of oxytocinergic and vasopressinergic neurons may be found ( Peterson , 1966 ; Duan and Ju , 1998 ; Khan et al , 1999 ) .
Most BR1 input to the BR2 is concentrated in the central part of the lateral division , whose connections suggest that it is involved primarily in the conduction of viscerosensory information from the medial nucleus of the solitary tract ( see Alden et al , 1994 ) .
Fourth , the BR1 sends a massive , very circumscribed projection to Barringtons nucleus in the BR2 , hints of which are found in earlier axonal transport tracing experiments ( Moga et al , 1990 ; Valentino et al , 1994 ) .
Fifth , BR1 projections to the BR2 are densest in the ventrolateral division .
Retrograde tracing experiments support the existence of a projection from a broad region , including the BR1 to the ventrolateral BR2 ( Gray and Magnuson , 1992 ) , the raphe pallidus and adjacent gigantocellular reticular nucleus ( Hermann et al , 1997 ) , the raphe pallidus ( Her mann et al , 1997 ; Nogueira et al , 2000 ) , and the ventrolateral medulla ( Hardy , 2001 ) .
Specifically , the medial part of the BR1 , which receives a dense BR2 input , and the BST rhomboid nucleus send dense projections to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve ( Hopkins and Holstege , 1978 ; Holstege et al , 1985 ; Liubashina et al , 2000 ; Dong and Swanson , 2003 ) , whereas the BST fusiform nucleus sends dense projections to the lateral parvicellular and forniceal parts of paraventricular nucleus ( preautonomic ) and medial dorsal parvicellular part of the paraventricular nucleus , where the corticotropinreleasing hormone neuroendocrine motoneuron pool is centered ( Dong et al , 2001b ) .
Specifically , the medial part of the central amygdalar nucleus , which receives a dense BSTdm input , and the BST BR1 send dense projections to the BR2 ( Hopkins and Holstege , 1978 ; Holstege et al , 1985 ; Liubashina et al , 2000 ; Dong and Swanson , 2003 ) , whereas the BST fusiform nucleus sends dense projections to the lateral parvicellular and forniceal parts of paraventricular nucleus ( preautonomic ) and medial dorsal parvicellular part of the paraventricular nucleus , where the corticotropinreleasing hormone neuroendocrine motoneuron pool is centered ( Dong et al , 2001b ) .
In addition , the medial and capsular parts of the BR1 and specific parts of the BST anterolateral group send dense projections to the dorsal region and BR2 of the lateral hypothalamic area , ventrolateral periaqueductal gray , parabrachial nucleus , and nucleus of the solitary tract ( Hopkins and Holstege , 1978 ; Holstege et al , 1985 ; Liubashina et al , 2000 ; Dong et al , 2001a ; Dong and Swanson , 2003a , b ) , all parts of the central autonomic control system .
In addition , the medial and capsular parts of the central amygdalar nucleus and specific parts of the BR1 anterolateral group send dense projections to the dorsal region and BR2 of the lateral hypothalamic area , ventrolateral periaqueductal gray , parabrachial nucleus , and nucleus of the solitary tract ( Hopkins and Holstege , 1978 ; Holstege et al , 1985 ; Liubashina et al , 2000 ; Dong et al , 2001a ; Dong and Swanson , 2003a , b ) , all parts of the central autonomic control system .
Finally , the BR1 , which receives a dense input from the BR2 , sends massive projections to the region of hypothalamic neuroendocrine motoneuron pools ( Dong and Swanson , 2005a ) .
Two other BR1 that receive modest input from the BR2 , the lateral septal and anterodorsal medial amygdalar nuclei , are also important for controlling neuroendocrine and autonomic responses associated with motivated behavior ( Canteras et al , 1995 ; Risold and Swanson , 1997b ) .
However , the BR1 , which receives a sparse input from the BR2 , sends the densest HVPG input to the growth hormone-releasing hormone and dopamine neuroendocrine motor neuron pool regions of the arcuate nucleus ( Thompson and Swanson , 2003 ) .
The BR1 also provides substantial inputs to the lateral part of the BR2 , a component of the rostral behavioral control column involved in the expression of masculine sexual behavior , and to the anterior hypothalamic nucleus , a component involved in the expression of defensive behavior .
The most obvious component here is the BR1 , which , along with the interconnected BR2 and substantia innominata , has been implicated in the control of locomotor behavior and reward expectation ( see Swanson et al , 1984 ; Mogenson et al , 1985 ; Mogenson , 1987 ; Wilson et al , 1995 ; Groenewegen et al , 1996 ; Ikemoto and Panksepp , 1999 ; Kelley , 1999 ; Parkinson et al , 1999 ; Tzschentke and Schmidt , 2000 ; Reynolds and Berridge , 2002 ; Wise , 2002 ) .
In contrast to the BST anterolateral group , the BR1 projects substantially to the BR2 of the epithalamus , especially to its caudal end .
First , the hypothalamic BR1 receives a dense BR2 input .
Fourth , the caudal BR1 receives a substantial input from the BR2 .
BR1 inputs to the BR2 were reported in the retrograde tracer study of Li and colleagues ( 1993 ) .
Functional implications : neural inputs Fragmentary structural evidence suggests that the BR1 receives direct neural inputs from the BR2 and cerebral nuclei ( striatopallidum ) , brainstem viscerosensory nuclei , and brainstem regions related to behavioral state control ( Fig 11 ) .
The BR1 receives a major input from the anterodorsal part of the BR2
For the same reason , projections from the BR1 to other parts of the BR2 ( nucleus accumbens and lateral septal nucleus ) and pallidum ( substantia innominata ) and to the behavioral state system ( especially the supramammillary and tuberomammillary nuclei ) also are not illustrated .
For the same reason , projections from the BR1 to other parts of the striatum ( BR2 and lateral septal nucleus ) and pallidum ( substantia innominata ) and to the behavioral state system ( especially the supramammillary and tuberomammillary nuclei ) also are not illustrated .

This is interesting in light of its projections to the BR1 , which in turn projects to the BR2 and region of the lamina terminalis ( Fig 11 ) .
The BR1 is also innervated moderately by ventral regions of the capsular part of the BR2 and lightly by its medial part ( Dong et al , 2001a ) .
In addition , the BR1 is innervated by the BR2 rhomboid nucleus ( Dong and Swanson , 2003 ) and caudal substantia innominata ( Grove , 1988a ) , both of which receive inputs from the central amygdalar nucleus ( Grove , 1988b ; Sun and Cassell , 1993 ; Dong and Swanson , 2003 ) .
In addition , the BR1 is innervated by the BST BR2 ( Dong and Swanson , 2003 ) and caudal substantia innominata ( Grove , 1988a ) , both of which receive inputs from the central amygdalar nucleus ( Grove , 1988b ; Sun and Cassell , 1993 ; Dong and Swanson , 2003 ) .
It seems likely that the BR1 receives direct inputs from the BR2 ( Ricardo and Ko , 1978 ) and central part of the lateral division of the parabrachial nucleus ( Alden et al , 1994 ) .
It seems likely that the BR1 receives direct inputs from the nucleus of the solitary tract ( Ricardo and Ko , 1978 ) and central part of the lateral division of the BR2 ( Alden et al , 1994 ) .
Recall that the same part of the BR1 receives an input from the BR2 .
The BR1 also projects to the region of the BR2/median preoptic nucleus , which projects back massively to the BSTdm ( Thompson and Swanson , 2003 ) .
The BSTdm also projects to the region of the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis/BR1 , which projects back massively to the BR2 ( Thompson and Swanson , 2003 ) .
Available hodological data on input from the BR1 and output to the BR2 ( Krayniak and Siegel , 1978b ; Atoji et al , 2002 ) suggest homology of the medial septal nucleus of birds with the nucleus of the same name in mammals .
In the present study , anterograde tracer injections in the BR1 resulted in terminal-like labeling in the perirhinal cortex and the dorsal endopyriform nucleus , the hippocampus , the medial septum diagonal band complex , lateral and triangular septum medial amygdala , the intralaminar thalamic nuclei , and the BR2 .
These data led us to conclude that there is a system of ascending projections arising from the BR1 to the median raphe , mammillary complex , BR2 , lateral habenula , nucleus reuniens , amygdala , entorhinal cortex , medial septum , and hippocampus .
These data led us to conclude that there is a system of ascending projections arising from the BR1 to the median raphe , mammillary complex , hypothalamus , BR2 , nucleus reuniens , amygdala , entorhinal cortex , medial septum , and hippocampus .
Labeled fibers to dorsal BR1 areas arose from labeled fibers in the BR2 .
In addition , injections of D [ 3H ] aspartate into the BR1 resulted in retrograde labeling in what Beart et al ( 1990 , Figs 2 , 9 . 3 ) called the central gray BR2 , which corresponds to the NI .
Basic organization of the hypothalamus The majority of connections within the adult forebrain are accounted for by a familiar qualitative scheme : the dorsal BR1 projects topographically to the entire BR2 ( see [ 267 ] ) , which in turn projects topographically to the basal ganglia , especially the striatum ( see [ 84 ] ) .
The overall organization of projections from the various thalamic nuclei to the entire cortical mantle is also firmly established , along with the organizing principles of outputs from the whole BR1 ( neocortex ) to the classical basal ganglia ( BR2 ) .
Furthermore , it is proposed that there is a basic scheme of interconnections between the BR1 , BR2 , and pallidum , with differentiations or specializations of this prototypical circuit element in various morphologically and functionally distinct regions of the cerebral hemispheres .

It is also similar in principle to the caudally adjacent reticular part of the substantia nigra [ 39 , 226 ] , which sends a branched projection to the brainstem motor system ( including the deeper layers of the superior colliculus and reticular formation ) and to the thalamus [ 16 , 266 ] ; and it is similar to the adjacent BR1 , which sends projections to the BR2 motor system and thalamus , in addition to other sites ( see [ 17 , 273 ] ) .

This information is relayed , at least in part , by direct connections from the nucleus of the solitary tract o the PVHd , and by less direct inputs relayed from the BR1 via the ventrolateral BR2 ( the lateral paragigantocellular reticular nucleus ) , projections to the PVHd that in part use norepinephrine , epinephrine , galanin , and neuropeptide Y as neurotransmitters [ 148 , 239 , 240 ] .

Current evidence suggests that the former are relayed to the PVHd by the BR1 and ventral BR2 , which in turn receive inputs from the prefrontal cortex , hippocampal formation , and amygdala ( Ref .

Information about behavioral state , and in particular about the circadian cycle , may reach the PVHd directly from the BR1 , as well as from the latter via a relay in the BR2 [ 324 ] .
The adult minimal or prototypical circuit element ( Fig 14 ) consists of : ( 1 ) an excitatory ( glutamatergic ) projection from cortex to the brainstem and spinal cord motor system , with an excitatory collateral [ 146 ] to the striatum ; ( 2 ) an inhibitory ( GABAergic ) projection from the BR1 to the brainstem motor system , with an inhibitory collateral [ 197 ] to the BR2 ; and ( 3 ) an inhibitory ( GABAergic ) projection from the pallidum to the brainstem motor system ( with an inhibitory collateral [ 197 ] to the thalamus ) .

The descending projection to the brainstem / spinal cord motor system from the BR1 ( synonymous with neocortex , a term better left unused in light of unfounded evolutionary implications ; see Section 6 ) arises primarily from layer 5 , whereas the isocortical projection to BR2 arises predominantly from layer 6 ; cortical associational / commissural projections arise preferentially from supragranular layers 2 and 3 ( see Fig 13 .
The BR1 then generates a GABAergic projection to the motor system , with a GABAergic collateral to the BR2 .
Finally , the BR1 generates a GABAergic projection to the brainstem motor system , with a GABAergic collateral to the dorsal BR2 .
According to this now widely accepted view , the caudate nucleus and putamen form the dorsal BR1 , which projects to the globus pallidus or dorsal BR2 ; whereas in contrast the nucleus accumbens , striatal fundus , and olfactory tubercle form the ventral striatum , which projects to the substantia innominata or ventral pallidum broadly conceived .

the striatum for hippocampal cortex It is now known that there is a topographically organized projection from Ammons horn cortex and BR1 proper to the BR2 ( Section 4 ) , that the medium spiny neurons there are GABAergic ( as in the dorsal and ventral striatum ) , and that there is a projection from the lateral septal nucleus to the medial septal / nucleus of the diagonal band complex It seems obvious that the latter , with its mixture of GABAergic and cholinergic neurons is a medial differentiation of the substantia innominata that is specialized with respect to connections with the hippocampal formation [ 124 , 169 , 232 ] .
A topographically organized projection from most of the BR1 to the entire BR2 was first demonstrated in 1961 by Webster [ 325 ] , and since that time it has become clear [ 59 , 166 ] that major contributors include the visual , auditory , somatosensory , and gustatory areas , the somatomotor areas , the orbital cortex and cingulate region , and posterior parietal and temporal association areas ( Fig 20A ) .
In terms of basal ganglia / cerebral nuclei inputs to the behavior control column , there is a topographically organized GABAergic projection from the BR1 to the BR2 ( see [ 59 ] ) , and most of these axons generate a GABAergic collateral in the globus pallidus ( see [ 197 ] ) -- and then there is a dense GABAergic projection from the globus pallidus ( both segments ) to the substantia nigra [ 102 , 262 , 265 , 298 ] .
In terms of basal ganglia / cerebral nuclei inputs to the behavior control column , there is a topographically organized GABAergic projection from the caudoputamen to the substantia nigra ( see [ 59 ] ) , and most of these axons generate a GABAergic collateral in the globus pallidus ( see [ 197 ] ) -- and then there is a dense GABAergic projection from the BR1 ( both segments ) to the BR2 [ 102 , 262 , 265 , 298 ] .
Axonal projections from the olfactory cortex and immediately adjacent regions that differentiate near the BR1 / basal ganglia , descend in the BR2 ( mfb ) , ventral to the obliterated lateral ventricle ( BD ) .
This is the basic triple descending projection from the BR1 to the motor system ( including the behavior control column ) discussed in Section 3 . 2 , and it tends to course through the BR2 / lateral forebrain bundle fiber system [ 282 ] ( Fig 20A ) .
Then , the BR1 sends dense projections to the BR2 and to the ventral tegmental area component of the behavior control column [ 104 , 105 , 188 , 287 ] , projections that are GABAergic ( see [ 126 ] ) .
Then , the BR1 sends dense projections to the substantia innominata and to the BR2 component of the behavior control column [ 104 , 105 , 188 , 287 ] , projections that are GABAergic ( see [ 126 ] ) .
And finally , the BR1 ( ventral pallidum in the sense of Fig 19 ) sends a presumably GABAergic projection to the BR2 , and other brainstem regions ( see [ 92 ] ) .
To the goal ( rostral ) segment The BR1 or medial striatum receives a topographically organized input from fields BR2-3 of Ammons horn or the hippocampus proper , as well as from the subiculum proper , via the precommissural fornix [ 225 , 286 , 288 ] ( Fig 20D ) .
To the goal ( rostral ) segment The lateral septal complex or medial BR1 receives a topographically organized input from fields CA1-3 of Ammons horn or the hippocampus proper , as well as from the BR2 proper , via the precommissural fornix [ 225 , 286 , 288 ] ( Fig 20D ) .
To the goal ( rostral ) segment The lateral septal complex or medial striatum receives a topographically organized input from fields BR1-3 of Ammons horn or the hippocampus proper , as well as from the BR2 proper , via the precommissural fornix [ 225 , 286 , 288 ] ( Fig 20D ) .
The BR1 in turn sends a descending , presumably GABAergic , projection to the medial septal / diagonal band complex ( medial BR2 ) and to most components of the rostral behavior control column ( see [ 225 , 289 ] ) .
Because of the highly topographic nature of projections from the BR1 to the BR2 , and from the latter to the behavior control column , it would appear that different dorsoventral zones within the hippocampus ( and in particular field CA1 ) influence different functional components of the behavior control column [ 223 , 225 ] ( Fig 21 ) .
By far the most dense striatal projection of the BR1 ( primary pheromonal cortex ) is to the BR2 [ 242 ] , which also receives massive inputs from areas of cortex associated with the amygdala ( cortical nucleus and postpiriform transition and piriform-amygdalar areas ) ( see [ 162 , 165 ] ) -- all of which in turn receive massive inputs from the main or accessory olfactory bulb [ 242 ] .
Perhaps the most dense striatal projections from the visceral area and adjacent posterior BR1 are to the central nucleus , which also gets heavy inputs from the amygdala-related cortical regions just mentioned as projecting massively to the BR2 ( see [ 162 , 165 ] ) .
The BR1 , and three principal cortical recipients of its output , the BR2 , tenia tecta , and piriform area ( see [ 208 , 241 ] ) , all project heavily to an unusual differentiation of the ( ventral ) striatum , the olfactory tubercle ( see [ 98 , 152 , 208 ] ) .
The BR1 , and three principal cortical recipients of its output , the anterior olfactory nucleus , tenia tecta , and BR2 ( see [ 208 , 241 ] ) , all project heavily to an unusual differentiation of the ( ventral ) striatum , the olfactory tubercle ( see [ 98 , 152 , 208 ] ) .
The BR1 does not project outside the cerebral hemispheres ; and at best the only brainstem projections of the BR2 , tenia tecta , and piriform area consist of light inputs to the caudal lateral hypothalamic area ( see [ 210 ] ) , and to the central part of the thalamic mediodorsal nucleus ( from the piriform area ) [ 210 ] .

The BR1 part of the ventral striatum has only one major projection -- to the immediately underlying BR2 [ 152 ] , although there is a lighter projection to the caudal lateral hypothalamic area from layer 3 [ 210 ] .

The hippocampal cortex ( Ammons horn and BR1 proper ) projects topographically upon the BR2 ( medial striatum ) , which in turn projects topographically upon the hypothalamus , including the rostral behavior control column ( also see Fig 20D ) .
The unfolded , flattened hippocampus is shown in the upper right , and field BR1 projects preferentially to the caudal BR2 ( LSc ) , which in turn projects massively to the supramammillary nucleus ( SUM ) .
The unfolded , flattened hippocampus is shown in the upper right , and field BR1 projects preferentially to the caudal lateral septal nucleus ( LSc ) , which in turn projects massively to the BR2 ( SUM ) .
The unfolded , flattened hippocampus is shown in the upper right , and field CA3 projects preferentially to the caudal BR1 ( LSc ) , which in turn projects massively to the BR2 ( SUM ) .
In contrast , field BR1 and the subiculum ( BR2 ) project preferentially to the rostral lateral septal nucleus ( LSr ) , which in turn projects topographically to the behavior control column .
In contrast , field BR1 and the subiculum ( SUB ) project preferentially to the rostral lateral septal nucleus ( BR2 ) , which in turn projects topographically to the behavior control column .
In contrast , field CA1 and the BR1 ( SUB ) project preferentially to the rostral BR2 ( LSr ) , which in turn projects topographically to the behavior control column .
For example , zone 2 in field BR1 / SUB projects to a restricted region of the BR2 ( rostral section through the SEPTUM , upper left ) , which in turn projects preferentially to the anterior hypothalamic nucleus ( AHN ) , part of the defensive behavior control subsystem ( Fig 12 ) .
For example , zone 2 in field CA1 / SUB projects to a restricted region of the BR1 ( rostral section through the SEPTUM , upper left ) , which in turn projects preferentially to the BR2 ( AHN ) , part of the defensive behavior control subsystem ( Fig 12 ) .
The precise region of BR1 ( substantia innominata ) receiving input from the BR2 has not been analyzed with modern anterograde tracing methods ; presumably it sends descending GABAergic fibers through the medial forebrain bundle .
The precise region of pallidum ( BR1 ) receiving input from the BR2 has not been analyzed with modern anterograde tracing methods ; presumably it sends descending GABAergic fibers through the medial forebrain bundle .
In addition , the BR1 sends a light projection to the BR2 [ 62 ] .
Furthermore , the external BR1 projects locally to the internal globus pallidus [ 131 ] and BR2 [ 212 , 265 ] , as well as to the cerebral cortex [ 232 , 236 ] .
Furthermore , the external BR1 projects locally to the internal globus pallidus [ 131 ] and caudoputamen [ 212 , 265 ] , as well as to the BR2 [ 232 , 236 ] .
In the rat BR1 , the internal globus pallidus innervates adjacent regions of the ventral anteriorlateral complex and ventral medial nucleus [ 43 , 313 ] , the paracentral and parafascicular nuclei of the intralaminar group [ 298 ] , and the BR2 [ 200 , 298 ] .
The reticular BR1 has rather widespread inputs to the reticular formation , including the BR2 / midbrain [ 17 , 83 , 86 ] , parvicellular reticular nucleus [ 45 , 321 , 339 ] , and medullary reticular nucleus [ 45 , 321 , 339 ] .

At a high level of resolution , studies of individual barrels in the vibrissal region of the rat BR1 demonstrate that a single cortical column sends divergent projections to multiple regions of the BR2 [ 6 ] , and it has even been shown that a single barrel generates two types of only partly overlapping terminal fields within the caudoputamen -- one diffuse and the other discrete [ 335 ] .
For instance , the BR1 ( PL ) of the medial prefrontal cortex projects to the dorsal , ventral , medial , and caudal BR2 ( Fig 23B ) as defined on regional grounds in Fig 19 .
For instance , the prelimbic area ( BR1 ) of the medial prefrontal cortex projects to the dorsal , ventral , medial , and caudal BR2 ( Fig 23B ) as defined on regional grounds in Fig 19 .
Striatopallidal inputs to cerebral cortex. We have seen that most of the BR1 projects massively to the entire BR2 , and that a restricted part of the cortex projects relatively lightly to most if not all of the pallidum .
Qualitatively , the BR1 , and both segments of the globus pallidus innervate the BR2 ; the magnocellular ( preoptic ) nucleus innervates olfactory cortex ; the medial septal 5 . 5 .
As noted above ( Section 5 . 2 ; Fig 24 ) some cortical areas project to several distinct regions of the striatum , and 142 LW Swanson / Brain Research 886 ( 2000 ) 113 164.

Anatomical evidence for projections from BR1 to BR2 in rat .
Thus , the BR1 projects to the BR2 [ 309 ] , the striatal fundus projects to the central amygdalar nucleus [ 96 ] , and the medial amygdalar nucleus projects to the central amygdalar nucleus , anterior amygdalar area , olfactory tubercle , striatal fundus , and lateral septal complex [ 38 ] .

In addition , the obscure BR1 and intercalated amygdalar nuclei appear to project to the BR2 , striatal fundus , and olfactory tubercle ; to the central and medial amygdalar nuclei ; and perhaps to the caudoputamen ( [ 194 ] ; H-W Dong , GD Petrovich , LW Swanson , unpublished observations ] .

Thus far we have emphasized a prototypical triple descending projection from different regions of the cerebral hemispheres -- with a particular region of BR1 innervating a particular region of BR2 .

pallidus [ 131 ] ( Fig 23D ) and vice-versa [ 298 ] , the BR1 projects to the BR2 [ 96 ] , the magnocellular ( preoptic ) nucleus projects to the medial septal complex [ 272 ] , the latter projects to the bed nuclei [ 80 , 289 ] , and the latter project to the substantia innominata and globus pallidus [ 64 , 95 ] .
Finally , each of the six major regions of the BR1 identified here projects more or less densely to one or more regions of the BR2 ( Fig 29 ) .
In fact , it seems likely that most if not all of the BR1 receives at least some input from the BR2 .
Confining the discussion to rats , the anatomical evidence demonstrates that each of the six major regions of the BR1 identified here projects to both the dorsal and ventral BR2 .
Overall , the BR1 innervates at least seven nuclei in the dorsal BR2 ( Fig 30 ) and two in the ventral thalamus.
As far as the latter are concerned , all regions of the BR1 except the external globus pallidus are known to innervate substantially the BR2 , and the external pallidum and substantia innominata project to the reticular nucleus ( see references in Fig 30 ) .
A summary of anatomically defined projections ( A ) from the striatopallidum and behavior control column to the dorsal thalamus , as well as ( B ) from these regions of dorsal BR1 to the BR2 , as seen in the rat .
Using the first genuinely new experimental pathway tracing method of the 20th century , they demonstrated unequivocally that the BR1 ( putamen ) projects to the BR2 and reticular substantia nigra ; that the external globus pallidus innervates the subthalamic nucleus ; and that the internal globus pallidus has a complex double projection -- one to multiple regions of the thalamus and the other to several parts of the midbrain tegmentum , including the fields of Forel and a region extending around the rostral pole of the red nucleus , and another region that includes the pedunculopontine nucleus and the midbrain extrapyramidal area of Rye and colleagues [ 229 ] .

It would appear , in fact , that more neurons in the internal BR1 of the monkey project to the BR2 than to the thalamus [ 103 ] , and that the pallidotegmental projection is more differentiated in monkeys than in rats [ 199 , 251 ] .
Second , whereas the BR1 / midbrain extrapyramidal area projects to the BR2 and globus pallidus , it also has well documented projections to the spinal cord and a large expanse of the reticular formation known to play a role in somatomotor responses ( the oral and caudal parts of the pontine reticular nucleus and gigantocellular reticular nucleus in particular ) ( see [ 94 , 121 , 158 , 179 , 230 , 333 ] ) .

( B ) Essentially the entire striatopallidum ( BR1 / basal ganglia ) generates a branched projection to the dorsal BR2 and behavioral control column , which in turn generates a branched projection to the dorsal BR2 and brainstem motor system .
The parts of the BR1 innervated by the BR2 and behavior control column are indicated in pink .
Sensory system Motor system LW Swanson / Brain Research 886 ( 2000 ) 113 164 151 152 LW Swanson / Brain Research 886 ( 2000 ) 113 164 Section 5 . 6 ) that both the caudal BR1 and the bed nuclei project to the BR2 , and it is easy to place the four nuclei of the extended amygdala within the framework of a caudorostral striatopallidum with projections to the motor system as well ( Fig 20F ; Section 4 . 2 ) .
For example , primary visual and primary BR1 of cortex , which have very different functions , both project to the dorsal BR2 ( caudoputamen ) , whereas the ventral striatum has been defined as containing such morphologically and functionally diverse components as the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle .

The BR1 ( CEA ) projects to the caudal BR2 and brainstem nuclei associated with the autonomic system ( not shown ) .
The central amygdalar nucleus ( BR1 ) projects to the caudal BR2 and brainstem nuclei associated with the autonomic system ( not shown ) .
The function of the lateral zone of the hypothalamus is less clear , but it is probably involved in the control of behavioral state and levels of arousal. The medial BR1 receives inputs from the cerebral hemispheres , as well as from the various sensory systems [ 226 ] and the state control system ( the BR2 is just one example [ 324 ] ) .
The reticular BR1 projects to most of these areas , as well as to the external and dorsal BR2 , red nucleus , and a nearby oculomotor-related cell group , the medial accessory nucleus ( Fig 22D ) .
The reticular BR1 projects to most of these areas , as well as to the external and dorsal inferior colliculus , BR2 , and a nearby oculomotor-related cell group , the medial accessory nucleus ( Fig 22D ) .
The BR1 and ventrally adjacent posterior agranular insular area of cortex project massively to the BR2 of the caudal striatum ( Section 4 . 2 ) , and it in turn has direct projections to components of the brainstem autonomic system , including preganglionic parasympathetic cell groups [ 117 ] .
The visceral area and ventrally adjacent posterior BR1 of cortex project massively to the BR2 of the caudal striatum ( Section 4 . 2 ) , and it in turn has direct projections to components of the brainstem autonomic system , including preganglionic parasympathetic cell groups [ 117 ] .
The visceral area and ventrally adjacent posterior BR1 of cortex project massively to the central amygdalar nucleus of the caudal BR2 ( Section 4 . 2 ) , and it in turn has direct projections to components of the brainstem autonomic system , including preganglionic parasympathetic cell groups [ 117 ] .
However , the BR1 [ 38 ] of the caudal striatum , and the infralimbic [ 119 ] , ventral subicular [ 40 ] , and posterior amygdalar [ 35 ] regions of cortex also project substantially to the ventral lateral septum / anterior bed nuclei , as well as directly to the visceromotor pattern generator network in the BR2 of the hypothalamus .
The green a indicates the BR1 , which arises from layer 5 pyramidal cells , and sends a collateral to the BR2 ( near L ) , whereas the green b indicates the corticothalamic projection , which arises mainly from layer 6 pyramidal cells .
In particular , the BR1 receives inputs from all parts of the central nucleus ( but not medial nucleus ) and from the BR2 , anterior basomedial nucleus , posterior basolateral nucleus , and postpiriform transition area ( Dong et al , 2001a ) .
In particular , the BR1 receives inputs from all parts of the central nucleus ( but not medial nucleus ) and from the anterior area , anterior basomedial nucleus , posterior basolateral nucleus , and BR2 ( Dong et al , 2001a ) .
After the rostrally directed fibers just described leave the BR1 , they provide dense inputs to ventral striatopallidal regions of the basal ganglia/BR2 , as well as light inputs to the lateral septal complex and medial prefrontal cortex ( Fig 3 ) .
After the rostrally directed fibers just described leave the BR1 , they provide dense inputs to ventral striatopallidal regions of the basal ganglia/cerebral nuclei , as well as light inputs to the BR2 and medial prefrontal cortex ( Fig 3 ) .
Upon leaving the BR1 these fibers enter the caudal end of the BR2 , where they branch infrequently but generate abundant terminal boutons and boutons-ofpassage ( Figs 4E , 5A ) .
More rostrally , dorsally , and laterally , innervation of the BR1 by the BR2 decreases very substantially ( Fig 4C , D ) .
The BR1 generates very complex intra-BR2 connections .
A distinct bundle of PHAL-labeled axons climbs dorsally from injection sites in the BR1 to enter the BR2 and follow it to the amygdalar region ( Fig 4IK ) .
In addition , a few axons from the BR1 extend through the BR2 into the lateral segment of the globus pallidus , where they extend caudally to join the ansa peduncularis ( Fig 4IL ) .
In addition , a few axons from the BR1 extend through the internal capsule into the lateral segment of the globus pallidus , where they extend caudally to join the BR2 ( Fig 4IL ) .
Thus , a dense , uninterrupted terminal field generated by the BR1 is observed in the restricted longitudinal zone of the BR2 illustrated in Figures 4EM and 6A .
A tremendous number of axons from the BR1 enter the BR2 from the caudal substantia innominata ( Figs 4L , M , 6A ) , in addition to those entering the caudal end of the nucleus from the stria terminalis ( Fig 4O , P ) .
A tremendous number of axons from the BSTrh enter the BR1 from the caudal BR2 ( Figs 4L , M , 6A ) , in addition to those entering the caudal end of the nucleus from the stria terminalis ( Fig 4O , P ) .
BR1 axons may also reach the latter via the BR2 .
BR1 inputs to BR2 .
As described in the preceding section , the massive descending bundle of BR1 axons in the BR2 ( Fig 4K ) splits at the level of the anterior hypothalamic nucleus into one branch that extends laterally through the ansa peduncularis to the amygdalar region and another branch that travels caudally through the medial forebrain bundle ( Fig 4L ) .
Just caudal to the paraventricular nucleus many labeled fibers from the BR1 extend medially from the medial forebrain bundle to innervate densely a restricted dorsal region of the perifornical BR2 , essentially between the zona incerta and fornix ( Figs 4O , P , 7C ) .
Finally , the BR1 generates a small pathway that goes directly to the BR2 of the hypothalamus ( Fig 3 ) .
Finally , the BR1 generates a small pathway that goes directly to the periventricular zone of the BR2 ( Fig 3 ) .
A few rostrally directed axons from the BR1 leave the rostral end of the BST to course medially through the nucleus of the diagonal band , and lateral and medial preoptic areas , to generate a few terminals in the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis ( Fig 4F ) and BR2 ( Fig 4G , H ) .
A few rostrally directed axons from the BSTrh leave the rostral end of the BR1 to course medially through the nucleus of the diagonal band , and lateral and medial preoptic areas , to generate a few terminals in the BR2 ( Fig 4F ) and anteroventral periventricular nucleus ( Fig 4G , H ) .
However , most of the fibers in the ventral periventricular pathway extend directly medial from the BR1 , initially through adjacent cell groups of the BST , and then just ventral to the crossing of the anterior commissure in the roof of the medial preoptic 457 area ( Figs 2A , 4I , J ) , to enter the BR2 at this level .
BR1 inputs to BR2 .
Finally , a small group of axons from the BR1 appears to follow a somewhat odd pathway to the BR2 .
These fibers enter the BR1 through the medial forebrain bundle and in the ventral tegmental area extend laterally and dorsally between the medial lemniscus and substantia nigra to enter the parvicellular part of the thalamic BR2 , where they generate a few boutons ( Fig 4U , V ) .
The nucleus reuniens , perireuniens nucleus , BR1 , and central medial nucleus also receive moderate inputs from the BR2 ( Fig 4MT ) , whereas only a few PHAL-labeled axons with terminal boutons were observed in the lateral habenula ( Fig 4Q , R ) .
The nucleus reuniens , perireuniens nucleus , rhomboid nucleus , and BR1 also receive moderate inputs from the BR2 ( Fig 4MT ) , whereas only a few PHAL-labeled axons with terminal boutons were observed in the lateral habenula ( Fig 4Q , R ) .
The nucleus reuniens , perireuniens nucleus , BR1 , and central medial nucleus also receive moderate inputs from the BR2 ( Fig 4MT ) , whereas only a few PHAL-labeled axons with terminal boutons were observed in the lateral habenula ( Fig 4Q , R ) .
The nucleus reuniens , BR1 , rhomboid nucleus , and central medial nucleus also receive moderate inputs from the BR2 ( Fig 4MT ) , whereas only a few PHAL-labeled axons with terminal boutons were observed in the lateral habenula ( Fig 4Q , R ) .
The BR1 , perireuniens nucleus , rhomboid nucleus , and central medial nucleus also receive moderate inputs from the BR2 ( Fig 4MT ) , whereas only a few PHAL-labeled axons with terminal boutons were observed in the lateral habenula ( Fig 4Q , R ) .
BR1 inputs to BR2 and hindbrain .
BR1 inputs to midbrain and BR2 .
In the rostral BR1 , labeled axons from the BR2 are concentrated in an intermediate zone of the rostromedial division ( Fig 4U ) , where they branch and generate moderate numbers of boutons , whereas most of the descending fibers appear to course through the medial division and immediately adjacent regions .
A few axons labeled from the BR1 extend dorsally from the periaqueductal gray to enter the deep and intermediate gray layers of the overlying BR2 ( Fig 4VZ ) .
As labeled BR1 axons in the medial forebrain bundle course through the BR2 ( Fig 4UW ) they generate considerable boutons ( and thus a terminal field ) and divide into two substantial branches , the smaller forming a median pathway and the much larger forming a lateral pathway .
Along the rostrocaudal extent of the ventral tegmental area , PHAL-labeled axons from the BR1 extend medially to enter the raphe nuclei and then continue dorsally and caudally toward the BR2 ( Fig 4VAA ) .
The vast majority of BR1 axons in the medial forebrain bundle course laterally from the ventral tegmental area , although a relatively small number extend through the floor of the BR2 , in what is the most direct descending route for the medial forebrain bundle to the medulla and spinal cord ( Fig 3 ) .
The vast majority of BR1 axons in the medial forebrain bundle course laterally from the ventral tegmental area , although a relatively small number extend through the floor of the pontine reticular nucleus , in what is the most direct descending route for the medial forebrain bundle to the BR2 and spinal cord ( Fig 3 ) .
The vast majority of BSTrh axons in the BR1 course laterally from the ventral tegmental area , although a relatively small number extend through the floor of the BR2 , in what is the most direct descending route for the BR1 to the medulla and spinal cord ( Fig 3 ) .
First , many PHAL-labeled axons from the BR1 course dorsomedially into the BR2 , where they generate a very dense terminal field in the ventrolateral division ( Figs 4YCC , 7E ) , and light terminal fields in the dorsal , dorsolateral , and other divisions .
The caudolateral tip of the BR1 receives a modest input from the BR2 ( Fig 4CCDD ) ; the parabrachial and pontine reticular nuclei will be discussed shortly .
One restricted region of the BR1 in particular receives a massive input from the BR2 : it is centered between the root of the trochlear nerve and the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus near the rostral tip of the locus coeruleus ( Fig 4DD , EE ) .
By far the largest terminal field generated by this caudally directed BR1 ( see Fig 3 ) of the lateral pathway is centered in the BR2 , and is established by fibers that course dorsal to , ventral to , and transversely through the superior cerebellar peduncle ( Figs 4CCGG , 7F ) .
Parts of the BR1 and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve receive an extremely dense input from the BR2 , with the fibers arriving from the underlying parvicellular reticular nucleus , as well , undoubtedly , as from areas of the reticular formation ventral to it ( Figs 4LLQQ , 8A ) .
Parts of the nucleus of the solitary tract and BR1 receive an extremely dense input from the BR2 , with the fibers arriving from the underlying parvicellular reticular nucleus , as well , undoubtedly , as from areas of the reticular formation ventral to it ( Figs 4LLQQ , 8A ) .
There is an interesting terminal field from the BR1 in the BR2 ( Fig 4OO UU ) .
As the medulla approaches the spinal cord , descending BR1 axons in the parvicellular reticular nucleus enter the BR2 , where they display terminal boutons and boutons-of-passage in both the dorsal and ventral parts ( Fig 4QQTT ) .
In the caudal interbrain , a small number of ipsilateral BR1 axons cross the midline in the BR2 to enter the contralateral BR2 and then descend to the periaqueductal gray and pontine central gray ( Fig 4TU ) .
Some labeled axons from the BR1 cross the midline in the commissural part of the BR2 to enter the contralateral BR2 and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve .
Some labeled axons from the BR1 cross the midline in the commissural part of the nucleus of the solitary tract to enter the contralateral nucleus of the solitary tract and BR2 .
Seventh , whereas all three BR1 regions appear to send inputs to the BR2 , only the BSTrh Control injections First , it is worth reiterating that there are three other distinct cell groups embedded within undifferentiated regions of the anterolateral BR1 area--the juxtacapsular , oval , and fusiform nuclei--and that the projections of each are distinct and characteristic , and are also different from those of the surrounding anterolateral area and subcom- 462 H-W DONG AND LW SWANSON Fig 9 .
Rostral projection to ventral striatopallidum and medial prefrontal cortex This pathway innervates the nucleus accumbens , striatal fundus , BR1 , and rostral BR2 , along with the infralimbic and prelimbic areas of the prefrontal region ( Fig 3 ) .
Fluorogold injections in the caudal BR1 retrogradely label neurons in all major subdivisions of the BR2 , including the BSTrh ( Brog et al , 1993 ) , and cholera toxin injected into the striatal fundus , in the region of the medial interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure , also retrogradely label neurons in the general region of the BR2 that includes the BSTrh ( Shammah-Lagnado et al , 1999 ) .
Indexing terms : prefrontal cortex ; hippocampus ; hypothalamus ; amygdala ; theta rhythm The nucleus reuniens ( BR1 ) is the largest of the midline nuclei of the thalamus and is the major source of thalamic afferents to the BR2 and parahippocampal structures , including the entorhinal cortex ( Wouterlood et al , 1990 ; Wouterlood , 1991 ) .
"This thalamohippocampal connection bypasses the trisynaptic/commissural pathway that has been thought to be the exclusive excitatory drive to CA1 . "" Although BR1 is a major input to the BR2 ( HF ) and one of the few direct routes to HF , very few studies have examined afferent projections to RE in Grant sponsor : National Institute of Mental Health ; Grant number : MH63519 ; Grant number : MH01476 ."
We confirmed the massive mPFC input to RE and further demonstrated pronounced projections to BR1 from several sites of the cortex , BR2 ( subiculum ) , basal forebrain , amygdala , hypothalamus , and brainstem .

By comparison with RE , control injections in the ventromedial nucleus of the BR1 ( VM ) gave rise to a very restricted pattern of labeling , mainly confined to BR2 and somatomotorassociated structures of the brain .
