To investigate the electrophysiological properties, synaptic connections, and anatomy of individual parvalbumin-immunoreactive (PV-IR) and cholecystokinin-immunoreactive (CCK-IR) interneurones in CA1, dual intracellular recordings using biocytin-filled microelectrodes in slices of adult rat hippocampus were combined with fluorescence labelling of PV- and CCK-containing cells
The present study was undertaken to establish the precise anatomical relationship of the subthalamic nucleus (STh) with limbic lobe-afferented parts of the basal ganglia in the rat
The results of these tracing experiments confirm the general notion of reciprocal connections between the subthalamic nucleus(STh) and pallidal areas
The reciprocal projection from this pallidal area to subthalamic regions appears to be very sparse
The nucleus accumbens sends a very sparse projection back to the medial subthalamic nucleus(STh) 
The projections of the medial subthalamic nucleus(STh) to the ventral mesencephalon appear also to be topographically organized
In addition, a number of subthalamic nucleus(STh) fibers reach the midbrain extrapyramidal area
These findings suggest a role for the subthalamic nucleus(STh) in nonmotor functions of the basal ganglia
The midbrain nucleus raphe dorsalis was the major site of origin for neurons providing a serotoninergic projection to the ventral posterolateral nucleus
The areal and laminar distributions of the projection from the parvocellular part of laminae C of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (Cparv) were studied in visual cortical areas of the cat with the anterograde tracing method by using wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase
In areas 18 and 19, the projection fibers terminate in the superficial half of layer I and in the full portions of layers III and IV, forming double bands
The present results demonstrate that the Cparv fibers terminate in a localized fashion in both the striate and the extrastriate cortical areas and that these W-cell projections are quite unique in their areal and laminar organization compared with the X- and Y-cell systems
During the pharyngeal phase of the swallowing reflex, the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) receives peripheral inputs from the pharynx by means of the glossopharyngeal ganglion and is the location of premotor neurons for the pharyngeal (PH) motoneurons
We investigated whether the neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract(NTS) projected directly to the pharyngeal(PH) motoneurons or to the other kinds of neurons in the ambiguus(AmS) by using the electron microscope
Although labelled fibers from these injections were seen throughout the brain, the region of the parabrachial nucleus and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) were most conspicuous in also having corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) immunoreactive fibers
These results strongly suggest that the corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area(LHA) activated by cellular dehydration provide an input to the region of the parabrachial nucleus
The interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure (IPAC) lies at the junction of the striatopallidal system and the lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis-central amygdaloid nucleus continuum (i
Local connections are found within medial IPAC and within lateral IPAC, but the two divisions are not interconnected
Labeling of sensory vagal projections was also found in the area postrema of both sides and around neurons of the dmnX
The ventral striatum mediates goal-directed behavior through limbic afferents
However, striatal regions caudal to the anterior commissure also receive inputs from the amygdala
There are also amygdaloid inputs to calcium binding protein(CaBP) -positive areas outside the shell, which originate mainly in the basal nucleus
Electron microscopic studies using combined anterograde tracing and pre- and post-embedding immunogold labelling have shown that the pathways originating from the CeA to the NTS are inhibitory and may use GABA as a neurotransmitter
The results of these studies suggest that blood pressure changes produced by activation of the CeA may be mediated by attenuation of baroreceptor reflexes through a GABAergic mechanism at the level of the NTS
The intergeniculate leaflet (IGL), homolog of the primate pregeniculate nucleus, modulates circadian rhythms
Here, descending intergeniculate leaflet(IGL) -efferent pathways are identified with the anterograde tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin, with projections to over 50 brain stem nuclei
The dorsal raphe also receives projections from the intergeniculate leaflet(IGL) and may contribute to both sleep/arousal and visuomotor function
The mammalian medial vestibular nucleus (MVe) receives input from all vestibular endorgans and provides extensive projections to the central nervous system
We utilised retrograde and anterograde tracing procedures to study the origin and termination of prefrontal cortical (PFC) projections to the periaqueductal gray (PAG) in the rat
This paper describes the quantitative areal and laminar distribution of identified neuron populations projecting from areas of prefrontal cortex (PFC) to subcortical autonomic, motor, and limbic sites in the rat
High-resolution flat-map density distributions of retrogradely labelled neurons indicated that specific prefrontal cortex(PFC) regions were differentially involved in the projections studied, with medial (m) prefrontal cortex(PFC) divided into dorsal and ventral sectors
Comparable data for the pretectal olivary nucleus(PON) show that this nucleus plays critical roles in the pupillary light reflex, light-evoked blinks, rapid eye movement sleep triggering, and modulating subcortical nuclei involved in circadian rhythms
Our investigation shows that the primate striatum receives both direct and indirect projections from M1
They divide as they enter the dorsolateral sector of the post-commissural putamen, the so-called sensorimotor striatal territory
The indirect corticostriatal projection derives from a thin collateral emitted within the corona radiata by thick, long-range fibers that descend toward the brainstem
The collateral enters the putamen dorsomedially and remains unbranched until it reaches the dorsolateral sector of the putamen, where it breaks out into two to four axonal branches displaying small and equally spaced varicosities
Both direct and indirect corticostriatal axons branch moderately but occupy vast rostrocaudal striatal territories, where they appear to contact en passant several widely distributed striatal neurons
The 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2(HSD2) neurons do not innervate the ventrolateral medulla, a key brainstem autonomic site
Consistent with this, there are direct hippocampal projections to the medial prefrontal cortex(mPFC) 
However, the significance of the latter projection remains unclear because no data are available regarding the rhinal targets of medial prefrontal cortex(mPFC) axons
In these two rhinal fields, medial prefrontal cortex(mPFC) axon terminals only formed asymmetric synapses, typically with gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -immunonegative spines ( approximately 70%) but occasionally with dendritic profiles ( approximately 30%), half of which were gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) immunopositive
In the light of earlier observations, these findings indicate that medial prefrontal cortex(mPFC) inputs exert mainly excitatory effects in the rhinal cortices, prevalently on principal neurons
The stimulation sites (left superior temporal gyrus [L-STG] and inferior parietal lobe [L-IPL]), modality of targets (visual and auditory), and task (pronunciation and lexical decision) were manipulated independently
The observed double dissociation suggests that the conscious task instruction modulates the stimulus-driven activation of the lateral temporal cortex for lexico-phonological activation and the inferior parietal cortex for spoken word production, and thereby engages a different neural network for generating the appropriate behavioral response
Dorsomedial prefrontal cortex might alter neuronal activity in areas such as motor cortex to inhibit temporally inappropriate responses
We then reversibly inactivated dorsomedial prefrontal cortex while recording ensemble activity in motor cortex
Inactivation of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex reduced delay-related firing, but not response-related firing, in motor cortex
These data suggest that functional interactions between dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and motor cortex might serve as a top-down control signal that inhibits inappropriate responding
Patterns of cortical label were related to myeloarchitecture in sections cut parallel to the surface of flattened cortex, and to coronal sections of the thalamus processed for cytochrome oxidase (CO)
Cortical sections revealed a caudorostral series of myelin dense ovals (O1-O4) in area 3b that represent the periodontal receptors of the contralateral teeth, the contralateral tongue, the ipsilateral teeth, and the ipsilateral tongue
The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is part of a forebrain system implicated in reward, motivation, and learning
The greater superficial petrosal (GSP), chorda tympani (CT), and glossopharyngeal (IX) nerves terminate in overlapping patterns in the brainstem in the rat nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS)
The caudal medial auditory area (CM) has anatomical and physiological features consistent with its role as a first-stage (or "belt") auditory association cortex
A companion paper describes the thalamic connections of caudal medial auditory area(CM) (Hackett et al
As expected, connections with adjacent caudal auditory areas were stronger than connections with rostral areas
Taken together, the findings indicate that caudal medial auditory area(CM) may receive somatosensory input from nearby areas along the fundus of the lateral sulcus
During stimulation of the subthalamic(STN) stimulation at 14-Hz, no change in either the mean firing rate or the discharge pattern of substantia nigra pars reticulata(SNr) neurons was observed
stimulation of the subthalamic(STN) stimulation at 140-Hz decreased the mean firing rate by 64% and the mean duration of bursting mode activity of substantia nigra pars reticulata(SNr) neurons by 70%
The substantia nigra pars reticulata(SNr) residual neuronal activity during 140-Hz stimulation of the subthalamic(STN) stimulation was driven by the stimulation of the subthalamic(STN) stimulation
How the decrease in rate and modification of firing pattern with evoked neuronal activity of substantia nigra pars reticulata(SNr) neurons during high frequency stimulation of the subthalamic(STN) stimulation contribute to the improvement of Parkinsonian motor disability remains to be elucidated
Based on developmental principles and insights from animal research about neuroplasticity in cell assemblies, this article is to propose a view of plasticity that promotes a link between hippocampal and prefrontal structure and function
Both the mitotic activity (counting of BrdU-labeled cells) in hippocampal dentatus and the maturation of dopamine fibres (quantitative immunochemistry of mesoprefrontal projection) in the prefrontal cortex proved to be a measurable combination for investigating the complex chain of events that relate activity dependent neuroplasticity to normal as well as to pathological maturational processes
In the hippocampal dentatus, where ontogenetic plasticity proved to be preserved by continued neuro- and synaptogenesis, serious damage can be internalized without simultaneous disruption of neural dynamics offering an approach to reverse dysfunctional reorganization in the prefrontal cortex
This study investigated the axonal projections of whisker-sensitive cells of the spinal trigeminal subnuclei (SP5) in rat oral, interpolar, and caudal divisions (SP5o, SP5i, and SP5c, respectively)
2) Two types of ascending fibers arise from SP5i: Type I fibers are thick and distribute to the posterior group(Po) and to other regions of the midbrain, i
Type II fibers are thin; branch sparsely in the tectum; and form small-sized, bushy arbors in the ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM)
The distribution of cortical efferent connections to the vestibular nuclei was quantitatively analyzed by means of retrograde axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase, wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase, and Fast Blue in rats
The present study describes the efferent projections and terminal distributions within the retrohippocampal region of individual layers of the rat medial entorhinal area (MEA) as studied by the methods of anterograde transport of the lectin Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and retrograde transport of the fluorescent dye Fast Blue (FB)
In this study, intergeniculate leaflet(IGL) and ventral lateral geniculate nucleus(VLG) efferent projections were compared by using anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin and retrograde transport of FluoroGold
In the temporal lobe, retrogradely labeled cells were most numerous in the rostral (polar) portion of the perirhinal cortex
Although retrograde tracers can provide only limited evidence for topography, we nonetheless noted that the density of retrogradely labeled cells in a cortical area reliably depended on the location of the tracer injection in the lateral nucleus
Injections of biotinylated dextran amine and Fluoro-Gold in the ICX retrogradely labelled neurons in layers 8-15 of the ipsilateral optic tectum (OT) that could carry this instructive signal
This projection was point-to-point and in register with the feed-forward, auditory projection from the ICX to the optic tectum(OT) 
Biocytin injected into the superficial layers of the optic tectum(OT) labelled bouton-laden axons in the ICX
These axons were generally finer than, but had similar bouton densities as, feed-forward auditory fibers in the ICX, labelled by injections of biocytin into the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC)
In several species, including primates, stimulation studies indicate that the infralimbic cortex, the most caudal part of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, functions as a visceral motor region
To determine the subcortical projections of this region in primates, injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinin, biotinylated dextran amine, or rhodamine-labeled dextran amine were placed in area 25 in three monkeys
This study examined organization of the projection from the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum to the ventral lateral nucleus (VL) of the thalamus in Macaca mulatta
The distribution of all contralateral terminal fields in the thalamus was charted, and representative individual axons that terminated in the ventral lateral nucleus(VL) were traced in serial sections under the light microscope
The results reveal a complex organization of the input from the ventral dentate to the ventral lateral nucleus(VL) that only partially fits into the traditional concept of somatotopic organization of the nucleus
The maturation of the main and accessory olfactory bulb projections to the ventral forebrain of the golden hamster has been traced by using the Fink-Heimer silver technique to stain degenerating axons and terminal arborizations after bulbectomy at different ages between birth and 33 days
Specific anatomical subdivisions of the nucleus of the solitary tract(NST) receive taste afferent input and contain interneurons and projection neurons that engage ascending or premotor taste pathways
cholera toxin B(CTb) was injected into the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract(NST) to label, by retrograde transport, the sources of forebrain inputs
Intramedullary cholera toxin B(CTb) labeling after nucleus of the solitary tract(NST) injection indicates that the rostral central subdivision also receives projections from the contralateral rostral nucleus of the solitary tract(NST) 
The anterograde tracer experiments indicate that projections from distinct cortical areas terminate primarily in individual longitudinal periaqueductal gray(PAG) columns
A previous study, in the primate, had demonstrated that distinct subgroups of prefrontal cortical(PFC) areas project to specific periaqueductal gray(PAG) columns
Anterograde tracing experiments revealed that the projections to different periaqueductal gray(PAG) columns arose from specific prefrontal cortical(PFC) areas
As well, consistent with the retrograde data, projections arising from select orbital and agranular insular cortical areas terminated selectively in the vl periaqueductal gray(PAG) 
We show that the nucleus receives inputs from several widely distributed areas in the forebrain and, to a much lesser extent, from the brainstem as well
Overall, the present analysis helps to delineate prosencephalic circuits seemingly critical for the organization of innate fear responses to environmental threats, where the PMd presents a major associative role
Furthermore, by means of massive inputs from the ventral tegmental nucleus, the PMd is in a position to integrate information from a neural system involved in spatial working memory, which may be of particular relevance for an effect of attentional mechanisms on the selection of appropriate escape strategies
Only area 4 projected to the magnocellular red nucleus, and this projection as small
The connections between the medial temporal cortical areas and CA1 of the hippocampus were examined in the Japanese monkey (Macaca fuscata) by means of retrograde and anterograde tract-tracing methods with wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) and fluorescent dyes (Fast Blue and Diamidino Yellow)
Each of these cortical areas was reciprocally connected with the entire rostrocaudal extent of CA1
In the coronal plane of CA1, labeled cells were located in proximal CA1 (i
, near the prosubiculum), but not in distal CA1 (i
The medial temporal cortical areas in direct reciprocal connection with CA1 were presumed to be involved in the memory system, especially in the system for declarative memory
The most prominent input to the olfactory bulb (OfB) originated from the diagonal nuclear complex
An exception was the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, which was poorly connected with the olfactory bulb(OfB) 
However, there was an accessory amygdala, which could be differentiated from the lateral nuclei by its intense reaction to NADPh-diaphorase
The variability of cell populations and olfactory bulb connections shown here may help to clarify both phylogenetic relationships and the significance of individual basal telencephalic subdivisions
, 2000 [accompanying study]), the nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) and its lumbosacral projections have been identified in the rhesus monkey
The present light and electron microscopical tracing study describes the periaqueductal gray(PAG) - nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) pathway in primates
In one of these three monkeys, biotinylated dextran amine and cholera toxin subunit b were injected into the lumbosacral cord to retrogradely identify nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) neurons
The results show that a compact group of neurons in the medial part of the lateral periaqueductal gray(PAG) at the intercollicular level sends a dense projection to the nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) 
It is concluded that there exists a strong and direct periaqueductal gray(PAG) - nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) pathway in the rhesus monkey
Auditory information from the posterior thalamus reaches the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) by way of two pathways: a direct thalamo-amygdala projection and a polysynaptic thalamo-cortico-amygdala projection
Furthermore, the extent and topographical distribution of bifurcating cells that project to both LA and auditory association cortex(AAC) are also unknown
There are no apparent differences in the size, shape, or density of terminal specializations in V1 or V2, and, consistently with previous double-labeling experiments (Kennedy and Bullier [1985] J Neurosci 5:2815-2830), some axons can branch to both areas
The retrospleniocollicular connection is of interest because it constitutes one link between the limbic system, which is considered the anatomical substrate of emotional experience, and the superior colliculus (SC), which mediates approach and avoidance behavior
Terminal fields originating in anterior and posterior regions of the retrosplenial cortex were preferentially distributed in laterodorsal and medioventral collicular regions, respectively, but there were also large, densely innervated regions in which the terminal fields overlapped
Fluoro-Gold(FG) injections in the superior colliculus(SC) confirmed the retrospleniocollicular topography and demonstrated that this connection originated from layer V pyramidal cells of all retrosplenial areas
The present results demonstrate that the retrosplenial cortex is the origin of a broad and dense network of axonal branches that may modulate superior colliculus(SC) -mediated motor and physiological responses involved in emotional behavior
The results support the subdivision of the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex(PFC) into "medial" and "orbital" networks and suggest that the prefrontostriatal projections reflect the functional organization of the prefrontal cortex(PFC) rather than topographic location
In part of a closer investigation of corticohippocampal systems, the authors applied single-axon analysis to the connections from the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) to the presubiculum
For 4 axons, branches were followed to area TF and to the border between the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices, raising the suggestion that these areas, which sometimes are viewed as serial stages, are tightly interconnected
Comparison of these findings with previous work on other species reveals striking similarities between the pretectorotundal pathway in turtles and birds and in the pretectogeniculate pathway in turtles, birds, and mammals
Corticostriatal projections from focal sites in both somatosensory areas exhibited substantial amounts of divergence within the dorsolateral neostriatum
We found that the proportion of overlapping projections to the neostriatum was moderately correlated with the amount of overlap observed in the thalamus
In the present study, anatomical projections from the medial geniculate body (MGB) to primary auditory cortex (AI) were investigated in normal adult cats and in animals that were neonatally deafened with the ototoxic drug amikacin
However, retrograde tracer injections into different regions of auditory cortex(AI) produced a normal pattern of labeling in the ventral division of the medial geniculate body ( medial geniculate body(MGB) v)
In both experimental and control animals, the main mass of labeled thalamic cells was found in the medial geniculate body(MGB) v
Different isofrequency contours in auditory cortex(AI) receive input from different portions of the medial geniculate body(MGB) v
The relatively normal thalamocortical projection pattern suggests that, after neonatal cochlear lesions, the major reorganization of cochleotopic maps occurs at subthalamic levels
We examined the organization of descending projections from auditory and adjacent cortical areas to the inferior colliculus (IC) in the rat by using the retrograde and anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase
The detailed organization of projections from the inferior olive to the cerebellar nuclei of the rat was studied by using anterograde tracing
The interstitial cell groups receive olivary afferents from the intermediate part of the medial accessory olive and from the dorsomedial cell column
A mediolateral topography was noted in the projections from the rostral half of the medial accessory olive to the posterior interposed nucleus
Projections from the dorsomedial group of the principal olive to the dorsolateral hump were found to follow a basically rostrocaudal topography
Its rostromedial parts are directed to the lateral part of the anterior interposed nucleus and its caudolateral part reach the medial anterior interposed nucleus
The objectives of the study were to investigate this backward projection and to compare it with 1) the backward projections that have been described previously in the early sensory areas and 2) the forward projection from area TEO to area TE
This excitatory input is most likely derived from axons that branch as they pass through the motor thalamus to the lateral habenula
These structures are thought to play differential roles in higher-order discriminative and homeostatic ( parabrachial nucleus(PBN) ) versus medullary reticular formation ( reflexive function(RF) )
After parabrachial nucleus(PBN) injections, approximately 18% of the Fos-like immunoreactive (FLI) neurons were double-labeled; after medullary reticular formation(RF) injections the proportion was 9%
On the other hand, regardless of stimulus, twice as many Fos-like immunoreactive(FLI) neurons projected to the parabrachial nucleus(PBN) as to the medullary reticular formation (RF) 
A plausible hypothesis for reconciling this apparent discrepancy is that many Fos-like immunoreactive(FLI) neurons make local projections in rNST, that in turn give rise to medullary reticular formation (RF) connections
Some afferents showed large, bulb-like enlargements (bulbs) and about 20 of these were found in the anterior and the intermediate octavomotor nucleus, whereas about 40 were found in the posterior octavomotor nucleus
In addition, vestibular primary afferents with bulb-like enlargements(bulbs) in apparent contact with vestibulospinal neurons were transneuronally labeled by biocytin
This anatomical organization suggests that afferents carrying bulb-like enlargements(bulbs) convey dynamic information to vestibulospinal neurons, which, in turn, project to the spinal cord networks
Previous reports using light microscopy have provided anatomical evidence that neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (PAG) innervate the medial pericoerulear dendrites of noradrenergic neurons in the nucleus locus coeruleus (LC)
The present study used anterograde tracing and electron microscopic analysis to provide more definitive evidence that neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray(PAG) form synapses with the somata or dendrites of noradrenergic locus coeruleus(LC) neurons
Ultrastructural analysis of anterogradely labeled terminals at the levels of the rostral (n = 233) and caudal (n = 272) subdivisions of the locus coeruleus(LC) indicated that approximately 20% of these form synapses with tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive dendrites; most of these were located in the medial pericoerulear region
These results provide direct evidence for monosynaptic projections from neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray(PAG) to the extranuclear dendrites of noradrenergic locus coeruleus(LC) neurons
In contrast, injections centered in the neighboring ventral lateral intraparietal area (LIPv) revealed inputs mainly from extrastriate visual areas, consistent with previous studies
Both extrabulbar primary and olfactory bulb projections course in diffuse pathways
Extensive overlap was observed between the targets of these extrabulbar primary olfactory fibers and those of the secondary efferent projections of the olfactory bulb, though the latter were more numerous and reached additional targets
Tracer application to the olfactory bulb also revealed a number of bulbopetal neurons in the ipsilateral and contralateral telencephalic areas, as well as crossed interbulbar projections
The presence in a chondrostean of important extrabulbar primary projections and their extensive overlap with secondary olfactory projections suggest that such projections are a derived characteristic of bony fishes
The projections from the parabrachial nucleus to the midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei were examined in the rat
The projections from the subiculum to the hypothalamus were comprehensively examined in the rat by using the anterograde Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and retrograde cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) methods
The paracentral thalamic nucleus received an input only from the internal lateral parabrachial subnucleus
Finally, the waist area of the parabrachial nucleus was densely labeled after cholera toxin-beta(CTb) injections in the parvicellular part of the ventral posterior thalamic nucleus
In addition, the developmental changes observed involve both reductions in the total number of thalamic neurons and a differential loss of cortical projections
In series of experiments it was shown that the focus of exciting neurons, forming the descending singular-autonomic discharge is localized in the infragenual area 25 of anterior limbic cortex
In another series of microelectrophysiological experiments it was shown downward blocking inhibitory influence of dorsal supragenual area 24 of anterior limbic cortex on activity of vagal viscerosensory neurons of bulbar solitary tract nucleus
Within the A2/C2 region in the nucleus tractus solitarii, 60% of the projecting activated cells were catecholaminergic, as were 59% of such cells in the A1/C1 region of the ventrolateral medulla
This suggests that oxytocin and vasopressin neurons within the supraoptic nucleus are stimulated at parturition via afferent inputs from the brainstem, but the input is not exclusively noradrenergic
Our laboratory has shown that electrical stimulation of the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vl periaqueductal gray(PAG) ) versus the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dl periaqueductal gray(PAG) ), in the rabbit, elicits two distinct behavioral/cardiorespiratory response patterns
Separate retrograde tracers were injected into functional subdivisions of the periaqueductal gray(PAG) and the amygdaloid central nucleus(ACe) in rabbits
Although double-labeled cells were never observed, afferents to the amygdaloid central nucleus(ACe) were often proximal to periaqueductal gray(PAG) afferents
To provide a quantitative comparison of the synaptic organization of "first-order" and "higher-order" thalamic nuclei, we followed bias-corrected sampling methods identical to a previous study of the cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN; Van Horn et al
However, in comparison to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus(dLGN) , the pulvinar nucleus receives significantly fewer numbers of RL, F1, and F2 contacts and significantly higher numbers of RS contacts
Thus, the RS/RL synapse ratio in the pulvinar nucleus is 24:1, in contrast to the 5:1 RS/RL synapse ratio in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus(dLGN) (Van Horn et al
mesencephalic command-associated nucleus(MCA) is part of the electromotor corollary discharge pathway, and its projection to ventroposterior nucleus(VP) suggests a feedback loop
Kitt and Brauth [1981] Neuroscience 6:1551-1566) and adjacent archistriatal regions can be subdivided into several distinct subareas that are chemically comparable to mammalian basal forebrain structures
The budgerigar septal region is theorized to be homologous as a field to the mammalian septum
The apparent counterpart in budgerigars of the mammalian nucleus basalis of Meynert consists of a field of cholinergic neurons spanning the basal forebrain
The function of the corticogeniculate feedback pathway from the striate cortex (V1) to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in primates is not well understood
Pressure injections of biotinylated dextran were made into owl monkey V1, and the resulting labeled axons were reconstructed through serial sections of the lateral geniculate nucleus(LGN) 
Unlike corticogeniculate axons seen in the cat, corticogeniculate axons in the owl monkey maintained topographic innervation in the lateral geniculate nucleus(LGN) layers that was consistent with receptive field sizes represented in V1
The distribution of retrogradely labeled neurons showed no clear segregation along the rostrocaudal axis of the claustrum; they were usually located along the entire anteroposterior extent of the claustrum
For all motor cortical areas, there was a general trend of the labeled neurons to occupy the dorsal and intermediate parts of the claustrum along the dorsoventral axis
The same territories were labeled after injection in area 46, but in addition numerous labeled neurons were found in the most ventral part of the claustrum
At higher resolution, however, there was clear evidence that the territories projecting to pre-supplementary motor area(pre-SMA) and SMA-proper formed separate, interdigitating, clusters along the dorsoventral axis
A comparable local segregation was observed for the two subdivisions of area 46, whereas there was more local overlap among the subareas of premotor cortex(PM) 
The results showed that estrogen induces axonal sprouting in a brainstem-spinal pathway in the adult female rhesus monkey
nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) projections to the lumbosacral cord are species specific and might be involved in mating behavior
In the female cat, this behavior is estrogen dependent, and estrogen induces axonal sprouting in the nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) -lumbosacral pathway
The effect of estrogen was studied on the nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) -lumbosacral projection with the use of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as a tracer in six adult ovariectomized rhesus monkeys with or without estrogen priming (three controls and three treated with 20 microg/day of estradiol benzoate subcutaneously for 14 days)
Light microscopy showed that the density of arborizing labeled nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) axons in the lumbosacral cord was greater in estrogen-treated than in control animals
These findings supported the concept that the nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) -lumbosacral pathway may be involved in sexual behavior
Moreover, they demonstrated that a long descending brainstem-spinal tract in adult nonhuman primates retains the capacity for axonal sprouting
By using an anti-dopamine serum, DR/PAG projections to Ce were confirmed to be in part dopaminergic
A small number of cells sent collateral projections to the ipsilateral cochlear nucleus and ipsilateral inferior colliculus
The double-labeled cells constituted fewer than 2% of the cells that projected to the cochlear nucleus or to the inferior colliculus
The results indicate that the synaptic organization of Gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) -positive profiles in the dorsal superficial subdivision of the medial geniculate nucleus(MGN) nucleus is very similar to that in other thalamic nuclei
Especially the dopaminergic cells, located in the pars compacta of substantia nigra(SN) ( substantia nigra(SN) c), are of great neurologic interest, because the functional deficit and depletion of these cells are the correlate of Parkinson's disease
We used a combination of in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on sections of human postmortem mesencephalon to investigate the expression of GABA(A) receptor subunit messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and of the receptor protein in dopaminergic substantia nigra(SN) cells
This might represent a negative feedback loop between the striatum and the substantia nigra(SN) c and be a target of pharmacologic interventions in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease
Relationships between the trigeminal component of blinking and the superior colliculus (SC) were studied in rats
To localize primary afferent eyelid projections in the sensory trigeminal complex, neuronal tracing experiments were performed as well as analysis of c-Fos protein expression after supraorbital (SO) nerve stimulation
The c-Fos immunoreactivity was observed in neurons located in the ipsilateral ventral parts of 5P, 5o, and the pars interpolaris (5i) and bilaterally in 5c
Injections in superior colliculus(SC) showed retrogradely labelled neurons predominantly within the contralateral part of the sensory trigeminal complex (28% in 5P, 20% in 5o, 50% in 5i, and 2% in 5c)
5) immunolabeling and confocal microscopy on thick sections to examine systematically the terminal arborizations of the various FSC endings and to compare them between two species, the rat and the cat, that have similar-appearing follicle-sinus complexes(FSCs) but different exploratory behaviors, such as existence or absence of whisking
Otherwise, the inner conical body of rat follicle-sinus complexes(FSCs) contains en passant, circumferentially oriented lanceolate endings that are lacking in the cat, whereas the cavernous sinus of the cat has en passant corpuscular endings that are lacking in the rat
The lateral edge of area X was marked by an abrupt change in the receptive fields(RFs) : Lateral to area X in the dorsal horn, they were strictly unilateral and relatively small
The development of the rat barrel field cortex was investigated with an antibody to the axonal membrane-specific phosphoprotein GAP-43 in order to examine the developmental pattern of afferent projections, and with cytochrome oxidase histochemistry and Nissl stains to reveal the morphogenesis of cortical barrels
The discussion focuses on brainstem-thalamic pathways that are likely involved in arousal, somatosensory, and visceral functions
In this study, we made restricted injections of Neurobiotin, which labeled small sectors (300-500 microm) of the cochlear spiral ganglion, to study the projections of auditory nerve fibers representing a narrow band of frequencies
Two injections spaced &amp;gt; or = 2 mm apart in the cochlea resulted in labeled bands of projecting axons in the anteroventral cochlear nuclei(CN) that were 53% broader than would be expected if they were proportional to those in adults, and the two projections were incompletely segregated in the youngest animals studied
Projections to the dorsal division of the cochlear nuclei(CN) were 32% broader in neonates than in adults when normalized, but the dorsal cochlear nuclei(CN) projections were always discrete, even at the earliest ages studied
The organization of backward projections from the anterior part of the inferotemporal cortex (area TE) to the posterior part of the inferotemporal cortex (area TEO) was studied in the macaque monkey by using the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L)

Projections from populations of leptin-responsive neurons in the mediobasal hypothalamus to melanin-concentrating hormone(MCH) and orexins(ORX) cells in the lateral hypothalamic area(LHA) may link peripheral metabolic cues with the cortical mantle and may play a critical role in the regulation of feeding behavior and body weight
Additional injections of retrograde tracers were made into the spinal cord to define the origin of corticospinal projections from the superior parietal lobule(SPL) 
Area PEip was defined as that part of area PEa that is the source of corticospinal projections
Considering the functional properties of the areas that form these circuits, it is proposed that the PEc/PEip-F2 dimple region circuit is involved in controlling movements on the basis of somatosensory information, which is the traditional role proposed for the whole dorsal premotor cortex
This insectivore shows one of the lowest size indices among mammals for both the cerebellar nuclei and the neocortex
The most remarkable finding may be the tenrec's cerebellar projection to the nucleus ventralis medialis
The projection to the caudolateral portion of the ventralis anterior complex (VAC) is located immediately rostral to the area receiving ascending somatosensory afferents and appears to originate, in particular, from the intermediate cerebellar nuclear complex
A faint-to-moderate projection, on the other hand, has been traced consistently to the ventral portion of the lateralis posterior-pulvinar complex and the adjacent dorsal geniculate nucleus
In addition, there are prominent cerebellosubthalamic projections to the zona incerta and the ventral geniculate nucleus

These bands of fascicles are divided along the midline in a "zone of reorganization" to create two full maps of the retinal surface; however, this map is discontinuous in that nasal and temporal quadrants are adjacent to one another
In the intracranial portion of the optic nerve, axons undergo another reorganization such that peripheral retinal axons shift position and become localized laterally and ventrally, whereas centrally placed axons become localized dorsally
In the ipsilateral chiasm, axons diverge to form three central, optic tracts: the medial optic tract, the projection to the corpus geniculatum, and the basal optic root
Anterograde labeling in the parabrachial nucleus was strongest in the external medial, external lateral, and ventral lateral subnuclei

There were sparse connections with an oval of densely myelinated cortex, which we have termed the temporal inferior area (TI)
Following specific neonatal brain lesions in rodents and ferrets, retinal axons have been induced to innervate the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN)
In a second group of experiments, newborn ferrets received different combinations of lesions of normal retinal targets and medial geniculate nucleus(MGN) afferents
Indeed, the presence of at least some normal retinal targets seems necessary for the formation of retino- medial geniculate nucleus(MGN) connections
These data are consistent with the idea that ectopic retino- medial geniculate nucleus(MGN) projections develop by sprouting of axon collaterals in response to signals arising from the deafferented nucleus, and that these axons compete with other sets of axons for terminal space in the medial geniculate nucleus(MGN) 
In some cases, there are distinct patches of parvalbumin(PV) immunoreactivity within layers III/IV of auditory cortex that appear similar to the patchy termination of thalamocortical axons labeled by the injection of anterograde tracers into MGV
Focal injections of the tracers biocytin or biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into the MGV labeled thalamocortical afferent patches within layer III/IV and retrogradely labeled corticothalamic neurons in layer VIa of the ipsilateral auditory cortex
Discrete injections of biotinylated dextran amine(BDA) into auditory cortex labeled bands of neurons in the ipsilateral MGV, whose orientation paralleled the fibrodendritic laminae characteristic of this subdivision
These studies provide evidence for the existence of multiple, chemically coded pathways linking primary auditory cortex and the MGV
The DZ was discriminated physiologically from the primary auditory field (AI) on the basis of neuronal responses with long latency and broad or multipeaked tuning curves
Together with the physiological findings, the present results suggest that the DZ is a potentially separate auditory field from auditory field(AI) and is likely to be involved in both temporal and spectral integration of acoustic information

The projection from 11 auditory cortical areas onto the subdivisions of the inferior colliculus was studied in adult cats by using two different anterograde tracers to label cortico-collicular (CC) axon terminals
Nuclei that participate in the premotor system, like the inferior collicular subdivisions that project to the pons, receive substantial corticofugal input
The cortico-collicular system may link brainstem and colliculo-thalamic circuits to coordinate premotor and perceptual aspects of hearing
In the present study, the hypothalamic connections of the human suprachiasmatic nucleus(SCN) were revealed for the first time with a newly developed in vitro postmortem anterograde tracing method

In squirrel monkeys, connections were also found with cortex on the ventral surface in the ventral occipital temporal sulcus
Small injections (n=15) of the anterograde tracers Fluoro-Ruby or biotinylated dextran amine were made into gracile, resulting in anterograde labelling often distributed in partially separate, rostrocaudally directed columns within the lateral half of the contralateral rostral dorsal accessory olive (rDAO)
Injections of retrograde tracer (green beads) into the C1 zone in the ipsilateral caudal paramedian lobule (7 cases), resulted in retrograde cell labelling in the middle one-third of contralateral DAO in two columns that fused caudally
Both granular and dysgranular posterior areas projected heavily to the dysgranular anterior insular cortex
Corticostriatal connections of auditory areas within the supratemporal plane and in rostral and caudal portions of the superior temporal gyrus were studied by the autoradiographic anterograde tracing technique

The reorganization of the adult hamster's lateral posterior nucleus after neonatal superior colliculus lesions was studied using primarily light and electron microscopic degeneration techniques
In contrast, the normal projection from the posterior neocortex is dense throughout the rostrolateral subdivision
Second, the ultrastructural organizatin of the rostrolateral subdivision was studied in adult animals whhich had received neonatal colliculus lesions
The contralateral colliculus and retina normally contribute only a few medium-sized terminals(M-terminals) 
The lateral vestibulospinal tract projects from an origin in r4, whereas a possible ascending tract of Deiters arises in r3

The organization of the magnocellular basal nucleus (MBN) projection to cerebral cortex in the rat has been studied by using cytoarchitectonic, immunohistochemical, and retrograde and anterograde transport methods
The distribution of retrogradely labeled basal forebrain neurons after cortical injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was essentially identical to that of neurons staining immunohistochemically for choline acetyltransferase
This peculiar distribution mimics the locations of pathways by which descending cortical fibers enter the diencephalon
Each cortical area was innervated by a characteristic subset of magnocellular basal nucleus(MBN) neurons, always located in close association with descending cortical fibers
Double label experiments using retrograde transport of fluorescent dyes confirmed that magnocellular basal nucleus(MBN) neurons innervate restricted cortical fields
galloti resembles in many respects that of other vertebrates, and differences are mainly observed in the pretectum and midbrain tectum
While the collicular or geniculate neurons within the injection site died within 48 hours of the injection, damage to axons and terminals of extrinsic origin within the injected region was not apparent
By contrast, injections of neurotoxins into the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus(DLG) and/or the optic tract of newborn rats did not result in a significant reduction in the numbers of retinal ganglion cells surviving the period of naturally occurring ganglion cell death
The period of sensitivity of retinal ganglion cells to the injection of neurotoxin into the colliculi extends from birth to about the end of the first postnatal week; the greatest sensitivity seems to be restricted to the first 3-4 postnatal days
We used the electron microscope to examine lamina I trigemino- and spinothalamic (TSTT) terminations in the posterior part of the ventral medial nucleus (VMpo) of the macaque thalamus
Small branches of the anterior lateral line nerve(ALLN) were labeled so as to determine the somatotopic organization in the posterior lateral line lobe(PLLL) 
The posterior lateral line lobe(PLLL) is divided into four segments from medial to lateral, termed medial, centromedial, centrolateral, and lateral segments (Heiligenberg and Dye, '81)
Up to 3 weeks postlesion the response to stimulation of nerve 5 consisted of a brief latency spike in interneuron A, similar to that in control animals and to stimulation of the intact nerve 4
Thus, the present data point out a peculiar neurochemical pattern of the habenular asymmetry in the frog, suggesting that nitric oxide may be involved in the developmental shaping which leads to an asymmetrical configuration of the habenulae
This latter finding supports the postulated relationship of the habenular asymmetry with the occurrence of the frontal organ
The finding of beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate(NADPH) -diaphorase histochemical reactivity confined to a distinct portion of the medial subnucleus of the left dorsal habenula prompted a reexamination of the cytoarchitecture of the developing and mature habenular complex in the frog
Synaptic activity was first recorded from the rostral colliculus at 45 days, and was found to be progressively more caudal, spreading to cover the colliculus, by 65 days
The ability of optic nerve fibres to sustain action potentials precedes their formation of functional synapses with collicular neurons, which happens abruptly at three months before eye opening
, features that are present in area V1 of phylogenetically distant mammals of quite different lifestyle and features that are common to other regions of cortex
Features of V1 common to both macaque and marsupials were then compared with anatomical features we have previously described for macaque prefrontal cortex
Pyramidal neuron patchy connections exist in the supragranular V1 in both the marsupial quokka and macaque as well as in macaque prefrontal cortex
Several specific types of aspinous interneurons are common to area V1 in both marsupial and macaque and are also present in macaque prefrontal cortex
Spiny stellate cells are a common feature of the thalamic-recipient, mid-depth lamina 4 of V1 in all three species
The hamster suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), site of the circadian clock, has been thought to be equally and completely innervated by each retina
Retinal projections to the suprachiasmatic nucleus(SCN) and other nuclei of the circadian system were simultaneously evaluated by using confocal laser microscopy
Each retina provides completely overlapping terminal fields throughout each suprachiasmatic nucleus(SCN) 
A dense terminal field from the contralateral retina encompasses, and extends dorsally beyond, the central suprachiasmatic nucleus(SCN) subnucleus identified by calbindin-immunoreactive neurons
The densest terminal field in the intergeniculate leaflet is from the contralateral retina, which completely overlaps the ipsilateral projection
These neurons are not confined to the raphe nuclei near the midline, but rather expand laterally in the reticular formation
Immunoreactive axons are distributed throughout the brainstem, but they innervate certain motor and sensory nuclei more densely

At early stages of development ( embryonic day 3(E3) -E4), each cadherin is expressed in restricted regions of the diencephalic wall of the neural tube
In the vitreal retina and optic fissure, large extracellular spaces resemble the oriented channels previously described in the mouse
In the optic stalk and diencephalon of the rat, similar spaces are not present, but the timed autolysis of neuroepithelial cells could provide a pathway of minimal resistance for the earliest axons
Degenerating cells are prominent in the ventral stalk and rostral diencephalon prior to the arrival of the first optic axons that preferentially invade these regions
In one strain of rat, Manchester Hooded, the retinae are heavily pigmented, but little pigment is seen at any stage in the stalk; in albinos, pigment is absent from both retina and stalk
Long-term depression (LTD) can also be induced in superior colliculus(SC) and LGN during the time at which these pathways are refined, and this Long-term depression(LTD) is partially dependent on nitric oxide(NO) and L-type Ca(2+) channel function
The second group, which reaches the cerebellum by P3, arises from new neurons of the same nuclear regions and from scattered cells of the spinal gray matter
The morphology and soma-dendritic distribution of anterograde biocytin-labelled rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF) synaptic endings in the oculomotor and trochlear nuclei have been examined by electron microscopy by using both preembedding immunoperoxidase and postembedding immunogold methods
In addition, uniquely dopamine(DA) -immunoreactive neurons, in contact with the cerebrospinal fluid, were observed in the hypothalamus and spinal cord
Suspension grafts of foetal tissue rich in cholinergic neurones were transplanted into the frontoparietal cortex of rats that had previously undergone deafferentation of the extrinsic cholinergic innervation of the cortex by injection of ibotenic acid into the nucleus basalis magnocellularis
The cortical tissue containing the graft was processed for electron microscopic immunocytochemistry by using a monoclonal antibody to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in order to examine the contacts established between cholinergic fibres from the graft and the host neocortex
choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive fibres in both grafted and control animals formed extensive synaptic connections with various cortical neural elements--those of graft origin being of similar morphology to those in the intact cortex
The spines of cells located in the caudal half of the medial accessory olive (type I cells, characterized by dendrites which run away from the soma) were found to be less complex than those of cells located rostrally in this olivary subnucleus (type II cells, characterized by dendrites which tend to turn back towards the soma)
Cells afferent to the optic lobe were identified by retrograde horseradish peroxidase(HRP) transport in the following lobes of the central ganglia: anterior basal, median basal, dorsal basal, interbasal, subvertical, precommissural, brachial, and magnocellular
Efferent optic lobe fibers into the superior frontal and lateral basal lobes were labeled by anterograde transport
The many inputs to the optic lobe from higher motor and associative centers in the central ganglia emphasize that the medulla region of the optic lobe is an exceptionally complex integrative area
The dense immunostaining in the medial nucleus accumbens was directly continuous with dense secretoneurin immunoreactivity in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis
This antibody identifies a subset of neurons in the cerebral cortex of various species including human and in organotypic cultures of rat cortex
Two orbital areas, 13a and 12o, had substantial connections to both networks and may serve as points of interaction between them; otherwise there were relatively few interconnections

Field potentials elicited by entorhinal cortex(EC) stimulation were recorded in the subiculum(SUB) 
These findings indicate that a topographical organization exists in the entorhinal cortex(EC) - subiculum(SUB) connections and that these connections are reciprocal
Unit activity both orthodromically and antidromically elicited by subiculum(SUB) stimulation was recorded in the entorhinal cortex(EC) 
Elasmobranchs possess a well-developed cerebellum with an associated cerebellar nucleus
To determine whether the organization of this nucleus is comparable with that of the deep cerebellar nuclei of mammals, we studied the dogfish cerebellar nucleus with light microscopic methods (Nissl stain, Golgi method, reduced silver stain, NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry and immunocytochemistry) and with electron microscopy
Application of horseradish peroxidase to the cerebellar cortex produced the labelling of beaded fibres of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar nucleus

, between basket and granule cells in the hippocampus, between Golgi cells and granule cells, and between basket cells and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum
The termination of the substantia nigra pars reticulata efferents in the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus was studied in the rat by using the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L)
However, the bulk of the nigral fibers appeared to terminate in the medial two-thirds of the ipsilateral subnucleus dissipatus of the pedunculopontine nucleus and exhibited a discrete dorsoventral topographical pattern
The terminal plexus displayed patches of uneven density, which was partly due to the numerous fiber bundles passing through the pedunculopontine nucleus, but also to an obvious preference of nigral fibers for some cells
In addition to a lack of melanin in the retinal pigment epithelium(RPE) , the albino retina is characterized by abnormal patterns of cell proliferation and cellular organization during development as well as cell-type specific deficits in the adult
In adults they primarily innervate neuroendocrine nuclei in the periventricular zone of the hypothalamus, including the paraventricular and arcuate nuclei (PVH, ARH)
Consistent with a role in regulating preovulatory luteinizing hormone secretion, rostral projections from the anteroventral periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus(AVPV) contact gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons surrounding the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis (OVLT)
Labeled anteroventral periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus(AVPV) fibers were not seen in the ARH of animals at any age
The intergeniculate leaflet(IGL) extends the entire rostrocaudal length of the geniculate complex and contains a distinct population of small to medium neurons
The intergeniculate leaflet(IGL) receives dense, bilateral input from retinal ganglion cells and dense substance P input of unknown origin
The organization of the intergeniculate leaflet(IGL) and its connections as revealed in this analysis is in accord with its role in the integration of visual input with other information to provide feedback regulation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus(SCN) pacemaker
Subcortical afferent projections to the medial limbic cortex were examined in the rat by the use of retrograde axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase
Somata of afferent neurons in the thalamus and basal forebrain were identified by retrograde labeling

Each layer of cells in the retina was evaluated employing light microscopy and measurements for quantitative analysis were recorded from the retinas of over 150 fish
Therefore, the goals of the current study were to explore whether the third optic neuropils in Pterygota and Decapoda are homologous, to examine the formation of the first two optic neuropils and the chiasmata in Crustacea, and to compare these processes with Pterygota
Transverse boundaries divide the cerebellar cortex into four transverse zones, and within each zone the cortex is further subdivided into a symmetrical array of parasagittal stripes
The rostral globus pallidus and the rostral substantia nigra in the same hemisphere were injected simultaneously with fluorescent tracers in three monkeys
In addition, the caudal globus pallidus and the caudal substantia nigra were injected separately in a fourth and fifth monkey with a fluorescent dye and wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP), respectively
, Szabo, '62, '67, '70, '72) and the dorsoventral axis is inverted in the projection of the neostriatum onto the nigra but not in the striatopallidal projection (Nauta and Domesick, '79; Gerfen, '85)
We did not observe changes in neurofilament(NF-M) expression in auditory areas or in song control nuclei in the contexts of hearing song or singing, although these contexts result in marked induction of the transcription factor ZENK
This observation suggests that neurofilament(NF-M) might not be under the regulatory control of ZENK in auditory areas or in song control nuclei
Two other imprinting-related areas, the medial neo/hyperstriatum ventrale (MNH) and archistriatum/neostriatum caudale (ANC), do show c-fos induction; however, the areas are not congruous with those demarcated by the 2-DG autoradiographic studies
In addition, c-fos is induced by first courtship and chasing in neurosecretory cell groups of the preoptic area and hypothalamus associated with the repertoire of sexual behavior and stress or enhanced arousal
Avulsion of a part of the olfactory nerve has similar effects as destruction of the olfactory bulb
Galanin-positive synapses were most prominent on choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons in the lateral parts of the nucleus of the diagonal band and in the posterior half of the nucleus basalis, which is where there was the greatest overlap between the distribution of galanin-immunoreactive terminals and choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons
Four locations were studied, including three on the basilar membrane and one on the basal limbus
"</BrainRegion> However, it remains unclear whether or not these pathways converge onto thalamic neurones in the border zone between motor and sensory thalamus
Microinjections of dextran-tetramethylrhodamine and dextran-fluorescein were made into the interposed and dorsal column nuclei, and labelled terminals in the thalamus were examined in the same sections
In this common projection zone, however, cerebellar and lemniscal terminals seldom intermingled, and they mostly occupied separate, discreet areas
medialis</BrainRegion>, projects directly to the optic tectum and to the mechanosensory nucleus of the torus semicircularis
Nucleus medialis receives input from primary lateral line nerve fibers as well as from a number of sites within the CNS: <BrainRegion>n
praeeminentialis pars ventralis</BrainRegion>, and the eminentia granularis and lobus caudalis of the cerebellum
The octaval nerve terminates in a column of five medullary nuclei
Of these, only the anterior and descending octaval nuclei maintain a direct but sparse projection to the auditory nucleus of the midbrain
This nucleus receives input from the descending octaval nucleus and projects bilaterally to the auditory nucleus of the torus semicircularis
It is suggested that the medial auditory nucleus of the medulla is homologous to portions of the superior olivary complex of other vertebrates
Serotoninergic fibers have been reported in both the abducens and facial nuclei of the cat
To resolve the issue of whether these two populations of neurons overlap, serotoninergic fibers were assayed in the abducens and facial nucleus; then the morphologies and distributions of identified serotoninergic neurons and oculomotor internuclear neurons were determined
Following injection of horseradish peroxidase into either the abducens or facial nuclei, double-label immunohistochemical techniques demonstrated that the serotoninergic and oculomotor internuclear neurons form two distinct cell populations
The latter were located in the oculomotor nucleus along its dorsal border and in the adjacent supraoculomotor area
In the chiasm, they are dispersed through the hemichiasm, with many axons approaching the midline and then turning back to enter the same side of the brain as the originating eye
In marsupials, by contrast, uncrossed axons never approach the midline; instead, they remain grouped in the lateral nerve and chiasm
We found that the Cajal-Retzius cells are most likely generated in the cortical hem by comparing with other cortical or extracortical origins
From their site of origin in the medial wall of the telencephalon, they spread in a caudorostral direction, following an oblique migratory path toward the lateral part of the neuroepithelium
What appears as preganglionic afferents from several spinal segments (C8-Th7) innervate gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic neurons in the sympathetic trunk which have ascending axons and focus their inhibitory effects on the cervical sympathetic ganglia, predominantly the superior cervical ganglion(SCG) 
Evoked potentials (EPs) to auditory click-train stimulation presented binaurally were recorded chronically from penetrating electrodes implanted in Heschl's gyrus (HG), from pial-surface electrodes placed on the lateral superior temporal gyrus (STG), or from both simultaneously, in awake humans undergoing surgery for medically intractable epilepsy
Evoked potentials(EPs) recorded simultaneously from Heschl's gyrus(HG) and superior temporal gyrus(STG) differed in their sensitivities to general anesthesia and to changes in rate of stimulus presentation
Results indicate that the acoustically active region on the superior temporal gyrus(STG) is a separate auditory area, functionally distinct from the Heschl's gyrus(HG) auditory field(s)
We refer to this acoustically sensitive area of the superior temporal gyrus(STG) as the posterior lateral superior temporal area (PLST)
Cochlear nucleus branches of thick olivocochlear axons were labeled by injections of horseradish peroxidase into the spiral ganglion of the cochlear basal turn in mice
We find exactly equal numbers of Müller cell trunks and foveal cone terminals, which may make the fovea particularly vulnerable to Müller cell dysfunction
Sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the T2-T4 spinal segments of the cat were identified by intracellular recording and antidromic activation from the corresponding white ramus
It seems likely that the strong physiological correlates of soma size which have been described among cat retinal ganglion cells and among the relay cells of the macaque lateral geniculate nucleus are generally present in primates
At the fovea, ganglion cells are smaller in soma size than in peripheral retina; they also seemed more uniform in size, although some distinctly larger cells persist in the human and bushbaby
Thus the primate retinas examined show features, such as the foveal specialization, which seem unique to them among mammals
Additionally, connectivity was analyzed in seven rats in which dorsal column nuclei and/or cortical projections to the area were labeled anterogradely with either 3H-leucine or wheat-germ agglutinin conjugated to HRP, and the animals were perfused and processed following various histological procedures (Nissl staining, autoradiographic processing, and histochemistry for visualization of peroxidase)
Lemniscal and corticothalamic afferents originating from the host were observed in the neonucleus when the fetal neurons had been implanted correctly into the lesioned area but not when they had been misplaced into either normal thalamic tissue or the internal capsule
These results are discussed with regard to the normal cytoarchitecture and connectivity of the ventrobasal complex of the rat thalamus
Dlx3 expression then resolves to the dorsal otocyst and gradually becomes limited to the endolymphatic sac by stage 30
A pair of long visual fibers projects from each ommatidium of the compound eye of the dragonfly Sympetrum
Nervous is an autosomal recessive mutation in mice (gene symbol, nr) that produces a progressive cerebellar and retinal degeneration
Following injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase(HRP) (WGA- horseradish peroxidase(HRP) ) into the spinal cord, midbrain sections were processed with a combined procedure that allowed visualization of both the retrograde tracer and one or more antigens including glutamate, glutaminase, and glutamatic acid decarboxylase (GAD)
The dendritic fields of 840 retinal ganglion cells labeled by injections of horseradish peroxidase into the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) or optic tracts of normal cats
In an effort to determine how retinal cells are generated and spatially organized within retina regenerated after ouabain injection, in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical techniques were combined with computational analyses of two-dimensional spatial patterns of identified neurons
The spatial patterns of inner retinal neurons in experimental eyes were also disorganized with respect to native retina
Subsequent to this time, labeling of Müller cells is significantly more robust, resulting in Müller cell domination of retinal autoradiographic patterns in more mature retinas
We conclude that the ability of retinal cells to accumulate 3H-GABA does not remain constant during postnatal development; rather each cell population displays a unique maturation sequence that results in a dramatic developmental shift in the number and types of GABA-accumulating cells present in the retina
Thalamic lesions resulted in a partial loss of 3H-nicotine binding in ipsilateral cerebral cortex
In each thalamic lesion group, the greatest decrease (35-45%) occurred within the cortical layers and area (i
Saturation analysis, performed in frontoparietal cortical tissue homogenates following ventral thalamic lesions, revealed a significant (34%) reduction in receptor density but not affinity
Direct excitotoxic lesions of the neocortex (temporal cortex) tended to preserve 3H-nicotine binding in layers 3/4, despite local neuronal loss
This organizing principle appears to apply not only to sensory and motor relay projections but also to association nuclei that project to allocortical areas
Projections to contralateral ganglia, the trigeminal motor nucleus, and the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus were also examined
Counts of labelled neurons yielded estimated totals of 1,700-1,800 cochlear and 400-500 vestibular efferent neurons
The present study tested the hypothesis that estrogen enhances the phenotype of cholinergic basal forebrain neurons and their cortical cholinergic innervation in young adult and aged ovariectomized rhesus monkeys
These data indicate that estrogen administered in a manner simulating natural hormonal cyclicity produces modest age-specific chemical phenotypic and regional changes in select neuronal subfields of the cholinergic basal forebrain and their cortical projection sites in nonhuman primates
In the adult rat cerebellum, perineuronal nets(PNNs) are found around large, deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) neurons and Golgi neurons and are composed of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), tenascin-R (TN-R), hyaluronan (HA), and link proteins, such as cartilage link protein 1 (Crtll)
Significantly greater numbers of activated neurons expressing the Neuropeptide FF(NPFF) gene (double labeled) were observed in the nucleus of the solitary tract(NTS) at the level of the area postrema in animals receiving intracerebroventricular(i
Whereas the two latter areas contain dense terminal networks, the diagonal band of Broca is occupied primarily by 5-HT fibers en route to other parts of the septum
Where fluorescent retrograde tracing was performed with 5-HT immunohistochemistry on the same tissue section, a prominent 5-HT containing pathway and a non-5-HT-containing pathway from the raphe nuclei to the septum were revealed
In this study, we examined whether the chloramphenicol enhancement of deafferentation-induced cell death reveals the same ultrastructural characteristics that are seen in degenerating nucleus magnocellularis neurons after cochlea removal alone
The percentage of nucleus magnocellularis neurons displaying ribosomal disintegration following cochlea removal was found to be markedly increased after chloramphenicol treatment
In the retina of mice homozygous for the retinal degeneration slow (rds) gene, receptor outer segments failed to develop and typical disc structures were never observed
At the time when outer segments grew in the normal retina, the optic ventricle in the mutant showed an accumulation of membrane-bound vesicles of varying size and density
The distribution of catecholaminergic and cholinergic neurons in the upper brainstem of the ferret were mapped by staining immunohistochemically two adjacent series of sections of brainstem for tyrosine hydroxylase and choline acetyltransferase, respectively
Choline-acetyltransferase-positive neurons distributed in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (Ch6) are smaller than the cholinergic cells of Ch5, and they stain less intensely for choline acetyltransferase

According to detailed qualitative observations Mes5 neurons appear as a primitive unique population along a thin dorsal medial band of the mesencephalon
According to quantitative analyses (changes in cell density along defined reference axes performed as a function of time and space), the definitive spatial pattern of Mes5 neurons results from a process of differential cell movements along the tangential plane of the tectal hemispheres
The mesenchymal population appears as an outsider subset of neurons that migrate from the cephalic third of the neural tube dorsal midregion to the mesenchymal compartment
Some sources of olfactory input to the opossum mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) were identified by retrograde horseradish peroxidase and anterograde autoradiographic methods
The tubercle- mediodorsal thalamic nucleus(MD) projection exhibited a definite spatial organization and included all except the most medial part of mediodorsal thalamic nucleus(MD) 
Most prominent Slack immunoreactivity occurs in the brainstem, in particular the trigeminal system and reticular formation, where very intense staining was found in both cell bodies and axonal fibers of associated nuclei
Within the auditory system, the medial nucleus of the trapezoid had a robust signal consistent with staining of the giant presynaptic terminals
The only cortical region in which Slack immunoreactivity was detected was the frontal cortex
gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic bipolar cells in the nucleus praeminentialis, a rhombencephalic structure devoted to feedback in the electrosensory system, project in relatively diffuse fashion to pyramidal cells
To understand the functional relevance of the subiculum as a major distributor of hippocampally processed information, detailed information about its neuronal organization is necessary
Because all four different regions of the subiculum share this paucity of collateralized projections, we conclude that subicular outputs generally originate as parallel projections
The medial cortex of lizards is a three-layered brain region displaying cyto- and chemoarchitectonical, connectional, and ontogenetic characteristics that relate it to the hippocampal fascia dentata of mammals
Of these locations, the diencephalon contained the most cells and the locus coeruleus the least cells
The caudal tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) + myelencephalic cells formed a single large group that spanned both the dorsal and ventral portions of the brain (A1A2)
) was histochemically localized in the normal retina and optic tectum of goldfish in order to examine the laminar and cellular oxidative metabolic organization of these structures
In SFGSd, intense reactivity was found to occur specifically within a class of large diameter axons and terminals that were apparently optic since these were also labeled with HRP and cobaltous lysine applied to the optic nerve

Following complete sensory deprivation, the volume of all bulbar layers, except the periventricular core, was homogeneously reduced along the rostrocaudal axis of the olfactory bulb
The most intense immunolabeling occurred in a population of liquor-contacting cells (tanycytes), located around the central canal, which extended processes to the dorsal, lateral, and ventral margins of the spinal cord
A moderate level of taurine immunoreactivity was also present in ependymal cells, located around the central canal, as well as in astrocytes throughout all regions of the spinal cord
The cerebellar cortex of the pigeon receiving direct vestibular afferents was delineated by anterograde transport of [3H]-amino acids injected into the vestibular nerve
A few solitary labelled rosettes were also found in more dorsal portions of lobule IX, as well as in the anterior lobe between lobule II and IV
Discrete injections of [3H]-leucine into the cristae of each of the three semicircular canals or the utricular macula yielded a similar distribution of fewer labelled rosettes
A few primary mossy fiber terminals labelled after cochlear injections are attributed to afferents from the lagenar macula
First, the organization of the nigrothalamic projections was studied by light and electron microscopy following injections of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) into the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra (SNR)
The greatest concentration of labeled cell bodies was found in the granular insular cortex and the adjacent area of agranular insula
A second intensely labeled region was found in stratum opticum and stratum griseum intermediate of the superior colliculus
Together with previous electrophysiological and neuroanatomical studies, the findings suggest that the suprageniculate nucleus(SGn) provides an integrating link between limbic structures and certain modalities of sensory information
By using optical imaging of intrinsic signals, we compared the maps of orientation and spatial frequency (SF) preference between central (0-3 degrees ) and paracentral (4-8 degrees ) V1 in the prosimian bush baby (Otolemur garnetti)
The purpose of this study was to determine the immunological correlates of blood-brain barrier breakdown in retinal xenografts in rats by utilizing skin grafting to initiate a timed immune response to the transplanted neural tissue
Embryonic day 13-14 CD-1 mouse retinae were grafted into the brainstem parenchyma of neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats
Furthermore, cortical regions representing the lower part of the visual field have a higher cell density than those representing the upper part; in four cases, 68-86% of all labeled cells were found in parts of area 17 representing the visual field below the horizontal meridian
Since there is an enlarged cortical representation of central vision, the much lower cell densities in "central" parts of area 17 than in "peripheral" parts may mean that all parts of the visual field are represented with equal numbers of corticopontine neurons ("linear" representation)
This is not the case, however, since the number of labeled cells per 10 degrees X 10 degrees is considerably higher in the cortex representing the central 10 degrees and medial parts of the lower visual field than in the rest of area 17
Assuming that the corticopontine cells in the visual cortex transmit spatially relevant information, we conclude that there is an overrepresentation of central vision and the medial parts of the lower visual field in the corticopontine projection from area 17
The epithalamus contains two widely recognized habenular nuclei
The posterior area contains the magnocellular preoptic nucleus and a dorsal arm of this nucleus, often placed in the ventral thalamus, was recognized
We have tentatively placed the posterior entopeduncular nucleus in the hypothalamus
In the present study, parvalbumin immunocytochemistry ( Parvalbumin(PV) i) and stereological methods were used to obtain estimates of cortical volume, total neuron number, laminar density, and the percentage of Parvalbumin(PV) -immunoreactive neurons in auditory neocortex
Transection of the chorda tympani or the IXth nerve resulted in the loss of expression of these molecules from the gustatory epithelium, indicating that they are expressed only on differentiated taste cells
The blood group antigens are lactoseries carbohydrates; they are differentially expressed in developing cochlear hair cells and olfactory neurons and may play roles in cell-cell recognition, adhesion, and other interactions important in the developing nervous system
Double-labeled neurons, however, were not observed after double tracer injections into LGNd and inferior olive(IO) 
Partial topographical segregation of the two populations was observed along the dorsoventral axis because LGNd-projecting neurons exhibited maximum density ventral to that of inferior olive(IO) neurons
Pretectal cells to the LGNd had cell body diameters between 16 and 48 microns
The horseradish peroxidase method was used to study the cortical projections upon the caudate nucleus in the cat
The cells of origin of the corticostriatal projection arise from both the supragranular (II and III) and infragranular (V and VI) cortical layers, in contrast to all other known corticofugal pathways to subcortical structures, which appear to arise only from the infragranular layers
The projections from the brainstem to the midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei were examined in the rat
Orthograde axonal transport tracing methods were used to describe the projections to the basilar pontine nuclei (BPN) which arise within the face representation of motor or somatosensory cerebral cortex
In contrast, the projections from somatosensory face (SF) cortical regions largely terminate in basilar pontine nuclei(BPN) areas separate from those receiving either limb sensorimotor or motor face(MF) inputs
Double immunofluorescence staining revealed that dopaminergic cells generally do not stain for DARPP-32, except for cells in the ventral hypothalamus and at caudal rhombencephalic levels
In addition, postembedding immunoelectron microscopy reveals that GluR2 is present in synapses of dorsal and ventral horn neurons and that the percentage of labeled synapses and numbers of immunogold particles per synapse do not vary between these spinal cord regions
These observations suggest that ovine corticotropin releasing factor-like immunoreactivity(oCRF-LI) material might be involved in the hypothalmic control of anterior pituitary hormone secretion in birds, and that neurophysin- and ovine corticotropin releasing factor-like immunoreactivity(oCRF-LI) -producing nerve cells might be functionally coupled
More than 95% of the neurons in the ipsilateral lateral geniculate nucleus(LGN) survive during the first 3 days following a lesion of the visual cortex
Three days after a lesion of the visual cortex, the mean cross-sectional areas of ipsilateral lateral geniculate nucleus(LGN) neurons are 13% smaller than normal (87%)
Astrocytes in the ipsilateral lateral geniculate nucleus(LGN) also react to cortical damage
At 1 day after a lesion of the visual cortex, glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity in the lateral geniculate nucleus(LGN) is almost undetectable, but a distinct increase in immunoreactivity is seen at 3 days
Thus, following a lesion of the visual cortex, the somata of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus(LGN) remain essentially normal morphologically for about 3 days before the onset of rapid atrophy and death
The afferent thalamic connections to cortical fields important for control of head movement in space were analysed by intracortical retrograde tracer injections
Anatomical evidence is presented that the posterior region of the ventroposterior complex is a special compartment within this principal somatosensory relay complex
The parietotemporal association area T3, mainly involved in visual-optokinetic signal processing, receives a substantial input from the medial, the lateral, and the inferior pulvinar
Some overlap in the thalamic relay structures projecting to these areas with those projecting to the vestibular cortices was found
A quantitative evaluation of thalamic regions projecting to different cortical structures was performed by constructing so-called "thalamograms
Following such injections, labeling is present within extensive regions of both the globus pallidus and entopeduncular nucleus, where it presents a mottled or meshlike appearance
Transported tracer is also present within the substantia nigra, where it is most abundant within the pars reticularis
In a separate series of experiments, horseradish peroxidase was injected into the motor cortex-specifically into the anterior sigmoidal gyrus
The prenatal development of the rabbit's retinal projections to the superior colliculus (SC) was studied by using anterograde transport of horseradish peroxidase injected intraocularly
On embryonic day 21(E21) contralaterally projecting retinal fibers invade across the entire superior colliculus(SC) 
Ipsilaterally projecting retinal fibers invade the rostral half of the superior colliculus(SC) on embryonic day 21(E21) 
On E29 the ipsilateral terminal field forms distinct patches and bands that are restricted to the rostrolateral quarter of the superior colliculus(SC) and are confined to the stratum griseum superficiale/stratum opticum(SGS/SO) border
The early widespread distribution of the ipsilaterally projecting retinal fibers to the superior colliculus(SC) and their eventual restriction in the fetal rabbit are consistent with the development of this projection in other mammalian orders
When this series of experiments was begun in 1984, the activity of each lateral superior olive (LSO) in the mammalian hindbrain was known to encode the hemifield of acoustic space containing a sound source
The orbital and medial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC) of macaque monkeys is a large but little understood region of the cerebral cortex
On the medial wall, areas 32, 25, and 24a,b,c have been delineated, in addition to area 10m
Just as the area-specific neurophysiological properties of these parietotemporal areas underlie broader regional functions such as visuospatial analysis, it is likely that the many small areas of the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex(OMPFC) also make differential contributions to the general mnemonic, sensory, and affective functions of this region
In addition, because these nuclei lie directly in the path of corticofugal and corticopetal axons during development, we have examined the relationship of these growing axons to the reticular and perireticular cell groups
Neurones were labelled by applying DiI, wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP), or HRP to the dorsal thalamus and/or cerebral cortex of rats at different stages of development
The axons of neurons in the reticular nucleus reach the dorsal thalamus as early as embryonic day (E) 14
At this age, and during later prenatal development, a small DiI implant limited to the presumptive lateral geniculate nucleus labels reticulothalamic and thalamocortical axons which travel in a clearly defined bundle through the thalamus
The perireticular nucleus is very large at a stage when the first thalamocortical axons leave and when the first corticothalamic axons approach the thalamus
Corticothalamic axons turn toward the reticular nucleus, and thalamocortical axons turn toward the cortical subplate
Our results demonstrate that the majority of zincergic projections to the barrel cortex arose from ipsilateral and callosal neurons, situated in cortical layers 2/3 and 6
Extratrigeminal projections were mainly to the external cuneate nucleus by way of a lateral descending trigeminal tract (lTTD; Dubbeldam and Karten [1978] J
No projections were seen to the trigeminal motor nuclei or to the cerebellum
A large amount of Glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive reaction product was observed in both the pallidum and entopeduncular nucleus in light microscopic preparations and was localized ultrastructurally to axon terminalis that surrounded dendrites and large somata
In the neostriatum the relative numbers of Glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive axons terminals per unit area were substantially less than in the pallidum
Glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive reaction product was also localized within the somata and dendrites of neostriatal and pallidal neurons in colchicine-injected preparations
The Glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive somata in the pallidum were medium-sized neurons and since such cells project to the substantia nigra, our results are in agreement with those from other studies which demonstrate a gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic, pallidonigral pathway
Lesions in the hippocampus or in the neocortex did not produce bleaching of the stain for zinc in the above-mentioned terminal fields
On the day of birth (PND-1), barrelettes are manifested as longitudinal, histochemical cylinders in sub-nuclei principalis, interpolaris and caudalis of the brainstem trigeminal complex(BTC) 
Recent evidence shows that other vibrissal representations--thalamic barreloids and cortical barrels--also follow these "afferent-before-target" and "row-before-individual units" sequences of development
Unilateral occipito-temporal cortical ablations (2 cats) also had no affect on the visual fields, but subsequent ablations of the contralateral superior colliculus produced permanent blindness in the hemifield contralateral to the ablated tectum
The effects of 3-acetylpyridine (3-AP) intoxication on the inferior olivary complex and cerebellar cortex of the rat were examined at both the light and electron microscopic level
The sensitivity of the olivocerebellar system to 3-acetylpyridine(3-AP) thus provides a convenient and selective means of eliminating all of the inferior olivary neurons and their axons, the climbing fibers of the cerebellar cortex
The origin, density and distribution of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactivity in cerebral perivascular nerves and the trigeminal ganglion of rats were examined in this study
The present study demonstrates that calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) , a putative neurotransmitter/neuromodulator, is especially abundant in the rostral cerebral circulation and is derived from the ipsilateral ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve
The first mutant, split eye, had no connections between the retina and the optic lobes
The other mutant, spindle, had reduced retinae that innervated reduced optic lobes with a normal-appearing orderly arrangement of neurons
Our findings confirm that afferent retinal input is essential for normal differentiation and maintenance of many optic lobe interneurons
The organization of certain of the major afferents to the hippocampus and dentate gyrus has been studied in normal and reeler mutant mice using the autoradiographic and the anterograde degeneration methods
However, there are a number of significant differences in their distribution; for example, in the reeler mouse, the entorhinal afferents occupy the entire radial extent of the stratum moleculare of the dentate gyrus, whereas in normal mice they are restricted to the outer four-fifths of this layer
Some of the developmental and functional implications of these and other abnormalities in the organization of the afferents to the hippocampus and dentate gyrus are discussed
The climbing fiber projection to the rat flocculus and adjacent ventral paraflocculus was investigated by using Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin as an anterograde and horseradish peroxidase as a retrograde tracer

Intense immunoreactivity for beta-arrestin-1 was found in the motoneurons in lamina IX of the ventral horn and elongated cells in the dorsal nucleus of Clarke
Six were bistratified cells with axons ramifying throughout stratum oriens (SO) and stratum radiatum (SR)
One was a putative axo-axonic cell with an axonal arbour confined to half of the stratum pyramidale(SP) and a narrow adjacent region of the stratum oriens(SO) 
The present series of experiments were designed to quantitatively document the response properties of nociceptive neurons in the rat trigeminal pars caudalis using the same electrical and innocuous and/or noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli employed in the characterization of nociceptive neurons with orofacial receptive fields in the rat superior colliculus
On these grounds it could be concluded that muscles active in the contraction phase of respiration are represented in the rostral subnuclei, the expansion muscles in the caudal subnuclei
The axial muscles of a given hemisegment are innervated by two or three primary motoneurons and a larger number of secondary motoneurons in the corresponding spinal segment, whereas fin muscles are innervated by a pool of motoneurons spanning several spinal segments
We examined cell number and expression of differentiation markers in the subventricular zone(SVZ) of adult rats after cortical lesions
Our results showed that microglial cells were present in all cerebellular lobules of both young and adult mice, but their distribution and morphology were not homogeneous throughout the cerebellum
This approach revealed separate pre-sympathetic and pre-parasympathetic neurons in the brainstem and hypothalamus
Next, selective retrograde tracing with two unique reporter pseudorabies virus(PRV) strains, one injected into the adrenal and the other into the sympathetic denervated liver, demonstrated that there are two separate populations of pre-sympathetic and pre-parasympathetic neurons within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus
Interestingly, this segregation persists into the suprachiasmatic nucleus(SCN) , where, as a result, the day-night balance in autonomic function of the organs is affected by specialized pre-sympathetic or pre-parasympathetic suprachiasmatic nucleus(SCN) neurons
The morphology of single retinal terminals in the optic tectum of the eastern garter snake was demonstrated by orthograde filling from extracellular injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the optic tract
Single axons exit a fascicle and course into either the stratum fibrosum et griseum superficiale, ventrally, or the stratum zonale, dorsally, where they bifurcate successively two or three times into preterminal branches
Although the existence of striatal and pallidal structures has been well documented in anuran amphibians, the exact boundaries of these structures have so far been a matter of debate
Neurobiotin tracing studies demonstrated that neurons projecting to the central and ventromedial thalamic nuclei are found in the intermediate and caudal striatum
In contrast, borders of the visual cortex toward the auditory and retrosplenial areas were essentially stable
The organization of cholinergic inputs to cat striate cortex (area 17) was studied by using a histochemical stain for acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
Because the cortically projecting cells in this region have been shown to contain choline acetyltransferase in a number of species, we postulate that the acetylcholinesterase(AChE) -positive fibers we describe in the cat striate cortex are in fact cholinergic
This study utilizes anterograde axonal transport of cobaltous-lysine and conventional silver-staining techniques to study the central projections of the horizontal semicircular canal branch of the VIII nerve within the vestibular nuclei of the carpet shark Cephaloscyllium isabella
Both fields appear to be located within the ventral portion of the nuclei indicating an apparent subdivision of the VIII nerve projections within the brainstem
In the area immediately caudal to the entrance of the VIII nerve a number of labelled primary afferent fibres project to the ventral region of the intermediate nucleus
Previous studies have shown that the distribution of callosal connections in the 17/18 callosal zone of the cat is patchy at a small scale, but the mechanisms that determine this periodic pattern remain unclear
The present study investigated this issue by correlating the distribution of retrogradely labeled callosal cells with the underlying patterns of ocular dominance columns (ODCs) revealed transneuronally after intraocular injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase
The results are consistent with the hypothesis that callosal linkages are stabilized during development by interhemispheric correlated activity driven by bilateral projections from temporal retina
Pyramidal cells in layers II through V of SmI cortex were labeled by the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase injected into ipsilateral MsI
Hippocampal neurons exhibiting kynurenine aminotransferase(KAT) immunoreactivity, distinguished as nonpyramidal cells, were very few in number and mainly distributed in strata oriens and pyramidale of Ammon's horn
The thalamocortical relations of the somatic fields in and around the lateral sulcus of the macaque were studied following cortical injections of tritated amino acids and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
Special attention was paid to the second somatosensory area (S2), the connections of which were also studied by means of thalamic isotope injections and retrograde degeneration
Following small injections of isotope or horseradish peroxidase(HRP) into the hand representation of S2, only ventroposterior inferior thalamic nucleus(VPI) was labeled
Comparison of injections involving different body parts in S2 suggested a somatotopic arrangement within ventroposterior inferior thalamic nucleus(VPI) such that the trunk and lower limb representations are located posterolaterally and the hand and arm representations anteromedially
Id receives its heaviest input from the basal ventromedial n
Finally, a third class of neurons had tangential arborizations in the medulla and axonal projections to the lobula and to the lateral protocerebrum
In addition, unilateral aspiration lesions of areas 17-18 were made at 5-28 days before death in order to determine whether degenerating terminals from visual cortex were glutamate immunoreactive (Glu-ir)
Following unilateral removal of visual cortex, normal RSD terminals were observed infrequently in the superior colliculus(SC) ipsilateral to the lesion
From the visual system, the superior colliculus and the lateral geniculate body were studied
The first optic neuropil of the compound eye, the lamina, of the skipper butterfly Parnara guttata, was examined by light microscopy after Golgi-impregnation and by electron microscopy (EM) to clarify the cellular and synaptic organization
Behavioral evidence indicates that altricial mammals possess olfactory function at early developmental ages, before the olfactory bulb has matured anatomically
Three types of parvalbumin(PV) -immunoreactive striatal neurons can be visualized in the human striatum: 1) the common medium-sized aspiny leptodendritic neurons, 2) some smaller and profusely arborized aspiny neurons, and 3) a few large and intensely stained neurons with conspicuously beaded and poorly branched dendrites
Axons of olfactory receptor cells grew into a dense dendritic zone of the olfactory bulb (comprising the dendrites of both mitral and tufted cells) between E17 and E18
The progressive development of seizures in rats by amygdala kindling, which models temporal lobe epilepsy, allows the study of molecular regulators of enduring synaptic changes
We mapped the induction of activin betaA mRNA in amygdala and cortex at several stages of seizure development
A similar temporal and spatial pattern of increased marker of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic neurons(mRNA) expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was found in the amygdala and cortex
The pontomedullary raphe magnus (RM) contains two physiologically defined types of neurons that participate in the opioid-induced modulation of dorsal horn nociceptive messages: OFF cells, which decrease, and ON cells, which increase their discharge rates when reflex behavior is evoked by noxious pinch or heat
, the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract contained only neurokinin B cells whereas the raphe nuclei had only substance P cells
Furthermore, activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated protein(Arc) was found exclusively in non-GABAergic alpha-CaMKII-positive hippocampal and neocortical neurons of rats that had explored a novel environment
We have charted, based on the results of 33 separate injections, the topographic distribution of cortical projections throughout the amygdala
Both the circumferential band of cells and the cells in the body of the inferior retina give off axonlike processes that run in the inner plexiform layer and do not enter the optic nerve
The superior retina, which contains only rare immunoreactive cell bodies, has a plexus of stained fibers comparable to that of the inferior retina
The distribution of this newly characterized peptide was investigated by means of immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization in the spinal cord and lower brainstem of the rat
To gain insight into cellular and molecular mechanisms subserving neuronal cell migration in the adult mouse forebrain, we have first investigated the cellular composition of the subventricular zone-olfactory bulb pathway (SVZ-OB)
Neuronal cells (precursors and some young postmitotic neurons) formed continuous cellular strands of migratory cells from the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle to the olfactory bulb
From the two types of grafted cerebellar progenitors, only those with migratory capability and that do not follow radial glial axes are able to translocate along the subventricular zone-olfactory bulb pathway(SVZ-OB) pathway
329:201-229) which examines pontine parabrachial(pPB) projections onto the Ce
It is suggested that the pontine parabrachial(pPB) (m)- bed nucleus of the stria terminalis(BST) L "diffuse pathway" is mainly implicated in motivational and autonomic aspects of taste
We found that CB1- CB1-immunoreactive(IR) axons innervated densely the majority of hypothalamic nuclei, except for the suprachiasmatic and lateral mammillary nuclei, in which only scattered CB1- CB1-immunoreactive(IR) fibers occurred
CB1- CB1-immunoreactive(IR) innervation of the arcuate, ventromedial, dorsomedial, and paraventricular nuclei and the external zone of the median eminence corroborated the important role of CB1 in the regulation of energy homeostasis and neuroendocrine functions
In conclusion, the study revealed the dense and differential CB1- CB1-immunoreactive(IR) innervation of most hypothalamic nuclei and the median eminence of the mouse brain
The regional distribution of intrinsic projections within the entorhinal cortex was related to the location of the cells of origin along the mediolateral axis of the entorhinal cortex
Cells located in the lateral regions of the entorhinal cortex gave rise to intrinsic connections that largely remained within the lateral reaches of the entorhinal cortex, i
, within the rostrocaudally situated entorhinal band of cells that projected to septal levels of the dentate gyrus
Cells located in the medial regions of the entorhinal cortex gave rise to intrinsic projections confined to the medial portion of the entorhinal cortex
These results suggest that entorhinal intrinsic connections allow for both integration (within a band) and segregation (across bands) of entorhinal cortical information processing
Catecholaminergic axonal varicosities identified by immunocytochemical staining for dopamine-beta-hydroxylase were observed at the light microscopic level apposing the somata of retrogradely labeled spinothalamic tract neurons in the monkey spinal cord
We also found dense transverse fibers in the retrochiasmatic area and supraoptic decussation, which suggests bilateral innervation of the histaminergic system
The greater part of the septal region is postulated to form from two separate anlagen which can be clearly distinguished in the telencephalon by E13 and E14
One lies in the anterior ventromedial wall and presumably forms the nucleus of the diagonal band, medial, lateral, and triangular septal nuclei
The other lies in the posterior ventrolateral ridge and presumably forms the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis and the anterior commissure
The same pattern is found in the medial and triangular septal nuclei and in the nucleus of the diagonal band
The differentiating cells of the lateral septal nucleus accumulate dorsal and lateral to medial and triangular septal nuclei
Gustatory afferent fibers of the vagus nerve that innervate taste buds of the oropharynx of the goldfish, Carassius auratus, project to the vagal lobe, which is a laminated gustatory nucleus in the dorsal medulla
) th that of CaBP in some of these nuclei (subdivisions of the ventral anterior and mediodorsal nuclei) and with PARV in others (centromedian nucleus)
During this period, GAD65 immunoreactivity can be considered a marker of the basal ganglia afferent receiving territory in the motor thalamus
) in the thalamic nuclei outside the basal ganglia afferent receiving territory
The convergence is defined as the extent of an afferent structure that contains neurons converging on a line normal to the cortical surface in area 17
The results show that a number of subcortical structures project to area 17 in a nontopographic manner, i
Much larger convergence and divergence values are found in the projections from the claustrum and the cortical areas
For example, the divergence reaches 20 mm for the projections from area 20 or from the anterior part of the lateral suprasylvian sulcus
Labelled axons collect in the central tegmental tract and ascend to the thalamic taste area in the medial extension of the ventrobasal complex
The majority of the fibers remain ipsilateral, but a few cross in the rostral pons and midbrain
Labelled axons grandually penetrate through the internal capsule, and ramify throughout the underlying substantia innominata
At the caudal end of the amygdala labelled fibers are visible in one component of the stria terminalis
These fibers can be followed over the dorsal thalamus into a smaller, but equally dense terminal area in the dorsolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis
The electrophysiological data demonstrate that pontine gustatory units can be antidromically activated by electrodes located in or near the central nucleus of the amygdala

Small choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive cells clustered around the central canal and scattered in laminae III-VI of the dorsal horn were detectable at birth
Fibers from all lesion sites in the caudate nucleus were found to terminate in the entopedunucular nucleus
In the substantia nigra, caudatofugal-fiber degeneration was confined in all cases to the rostal part of the pars reticulata, and was densest in the medial one-half of this nucleus
Only from lesions in the ventromedial part of the caudate nucleus could degenerating fibers be traced to the nucleus ansae lenticularis
The results of this study are in agreement with evidence of neurogenesis of granular neurons in the adult rat olfactory bulb and dentate gyrus (Kaplan and Hinds, '77)
In some sections, substance P-positive fibers were found primarily in areas of the ventromedial lateral cervical nucleus(LCN) containing small neurons, indicating that such fibers may be involved in functions of the lateral cervical nucleus(LCN) associated with nociceptive projection neurons and/or local circuit neurons
Twelve hypoglossal motoneurons stained with horseradish peroxidase(HRP) were antidromically activated by stimulation applied to the medial branch of hypoglossal nerve
We have found that the midbrain tegmentum is a major terminal zone for tectal efferent projections
Multiple injections produced patchy anterograde and retrograde labelling in the nucleus isthmi, with the number of patches corresponding to the number of tectal sites injected
Single injections produced labelling in restricted regions of the nucleus isthmi, the location of which varied systematically with the location of the tectal injection site
In comparison with the lateral geniculate body(LGB) , visual cortex(VC) neuroblasts were quite rare on ED 14 and were present only in layer VI
In the superior colliculus(SC) the last neurons arose between ED 18 and ED 20, and in the visual cortex(VC) , with the possible exception of a few granular neurons (which may continue division into the first few days postnatally), proliferation continued until the end of gestation
In the visual cortex(VC) , and partly also in the superior colliculus(SC) , an inside-out pattern of proliferation and neuron formation was confirmed
The basic structural organization of axonal projections from the small but distinct magnocellular and ventral nuclei (of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis) was analyzed with the Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin anterograde tract tracing method in adult male rats
At the level of the deep mesencephalic nucleus(DMN) , projections from its lateral part crossed the midline and terminated in the medial and lateral part of the contralateral deep mesencephalic nucleus(DMN) 
One tract coursed dorsolaterally from the lateral deep mesencephalic nucleus(DMN) to terminate in the ipsilateral lateral thalamic nucleus
The second tract coursed ventrally and rostrally over the substantia nigra toward the ipsilateral zona incerta
Some of these fibers terminated upon neurons of the zona incerta and the ventromedial part of the subthalamic nucleus
The remaining fibers within the zona incerta coursed anteriorly to enter the internal capsule
These fibers terminated in the entopeduncular nucleus and medial part of the globus pallidus
In long penetrations down the anterior wall of the central sulcus we were able to advance the electrode tangentially through cortex
Efferent fibres from both nuclei project predominantly to areas of the thalamus, which in turn project to the motor cortex
In this study, single and double anterograde-tracing techniques have been used to examine and compare the pathways from the lateral and interposed nuclei to the thalamus in the rat by using both light and electron microscopy to look for evidence of organisational or structural features that may underlie the proposed functional differences between these nuclei
The structure of terminals from the lateral and interposed nuclei, however, as well as their synaptic relationship with thalamic neurones, were found to be similar
A monoclonal antibody recognizing the p75 receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF) was used to assess the immunohistochemical expression of nerve growth factor(NGF) receptors within the developing human neo-, limbic, and paralimbic cortices as well as the hippocampal complex
nerve growth factor(NGF) receptor-immunoreactive subplate neurons displayed a topographic distribution with the heaviest concentration found within limbic and paralimbic cortices as well as association neocortex
The expression of nerve growth factor(NGF) receptor-immunoreactivity increased within the subplate zone of the pre- and parasubiculum culminating in intense entorhinal cortex staining
As the entorhinal cortex merged with the developing inferior temporal association cortex, there was a marked reduction in staining intensity
The incipient fovea is present at fetal day (Fd) 100 as the only part of the retina that contains five distinct layers, including a single layer of cone photoreceptors
A foveal pit begins to form at fetal day(Fd) 135 in the center of the foveal avascular zone which is surrounded by a ring of blood vessels (BV) and astrocytes
At birth ( fetal day(Fd) 144) the fovea has a single layer of cones over the pit center where the inner retinal layers are thinned but still separated
After birth the fovea rapidly matures so that foveal cone and pit morphology are similar to adult by 4 months
Ventrotemporal retinal ganglion cell(RGC) axons, located initially at the caudal edge of the tract, move toward and come to be positioned laterally to, the column of ventronasal retinal ganglion cell(RGC) axons
The column of dorsonasal retinal ganglion cell(RGC) axons moves from the rostral to the lateral side of the column of dorsotemporal retinal ganglion cell(RGC) axons
Furthermore, the rearrangements that occur do not involve any alterations in the positions of central and peripheral retinal ganglion cell(RGC) axons with respect to the surface of the diencephalon
Expression of the Mecp2e2 splice variant became largely restricted to nuclei within the dorsal thalamus (DT) and cortical layer V in juvenile animals, a pattern that was maintained into adulthood
Unlike prior studies, our study focused on the amygdala and ventromedial hypothalamus(VMH) , because they are involved in social behaviors and may underlie behavioral differences between the species
Meadow voles had a higher density of cells labeled with the cell proliferation marker 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) in the amygdala and DG than did prairie voles
Furthermore, the majority of the 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine(BrdU) -labeled cells in the posterior cortical(pCorA) and pMeA displayed either a neuronal or a glial progenitor phenotype, but no species or treatment differences were found in the percentage of neuronal or glial progenitor cells
Stimulus-evoked metabolic activity in the anterior parietal cortex (areas 3a, 3b, 1, and 2) occurs in the form of column-like patches
If a type of projection connecting areas 3a, 3b, 1, and 2 transmits sensory information among these cortical fields, the resultant projection pattern may directly contribute to the definition of somatosensory metabolic "columns
" To test this possibility, electrophysiological recordings in areas 3b and 1 of Macaca fascicularis monkeys characterized stimuli that elicited the best neuronal response at a specific cortical site
After injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) into physiologically defined loci in area 3b, the patches of transported label within areas 3b and 1 were colocalized with evoked metabolic activity
Patches of anterograde label found in area 3b after area 1 injections, however, were not coincident with the metabolically activated patches
These findings suggest that excitatory information is transmitted from area 3b to area 1 in a way that connects clusters of cells with similar response properties
The patterns of striatal 5'-nucleotidase activity in these animals were compared in serial sections to the patterns of calbindin-D28k immunoreactivity and of 3H-naloxone ligand binding, which respectively mark the known matrix and striosome (patch) compartments of the caudoputamen
Toropetal neurons of the descending octaval nucleus(DO) were within the saccular terminal zone
Of particular note is the medial pretoral nucleus, which received fibers from diencephalic auditory nuclei
The nucleus gave rise to indirect descending pathways to a medial zone of the cerebellar crest where dendrites of crest cells in the secondary octaval population(SO) ramify
Unlike most vertebrates that have the saccule and lagena as two separate pouches ventral to the utricle, the lungfish has a single large ventral pouch that contains a single large pasty otoconial mass
This mass covers two hair cell patches, each like a striola with prominent hair cell ciliary bundles, that are presumed to represent saccular and lagenar maculae
The more caudal lagenar striola is a vertically elongated stripe with hair cell orientation vectors facing antiparallel on either side of a midline drawn vertically along the macula, resembling the macula lagena of some bony fishes but not of tetrapods
A distribution-free stereological method was applied to compute the size and number of glomeruli either along the bulbar rostrocaudal extent or in the bulbar coronal plane
The purpose of this study was to identify thalamic areas receiving convergent sensory inputs from acoustic and spinal projection systems in the rat
In rodents, the whisker representation in primary somatosensory (SI) cortex projects to the dorsolateral neostriatum, but the location of these projections has never been characterized with respect to layer IV barrels and their intervening septa
To address this issue, we injected a retrograde tracer into the dorsolateral neostriatum and then reconstructed the location of the labeled corticostriatal neurons with respect to the cytochrome oxidase (CO)-labeled barrels in SI
In the striatum, gradients of neuropil immunostaining define four major territories: The first (T1) includes all but the rostroventral half of the putamen and is characterized by enhanced matriceal parvalbumin(PV) and SMI-32 immunoreactivity (-ir)
The second territory (T2) encompasses most part of the caudate nucleus (Cd) and rostral putamen (PuT), which show enhanced matriceal calbindin-D28K(CB) -ir
In this study, angiotensin converting enzyme was mapped in the human basal forebrain and midbrain by using quantitative in vitro autoradiography employing a derivative of a potent converting enzyme inhibitor, 125I-351A, as radioligand
The organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, one of the circumventricular organs, displays the highest concentration of binding
In the midbrain, a moderate density of binding is detected in the periaqueductal gray
Angiotensin converting enzyme is heterogeneously distributed in the caudate nucleus and putamen, with distinct patches of high concentration surrounded by a matrix of diffuse, lower levels
prior to pseudorabies virus(PRV) inoculation of the spleen, were located in T(3)-T(12) bilaterally; numerous infected interneurons were also found in the thoracic spinal cord (T(1)-T(13))
These results demonstrate that the sympathetic outflow to the spleen is controlled by a complex multisynaptic pathway that involves several brainstem and forebrain nuclei
The output of these nuclei is direct to the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus, where binaural inputs synapse with monaural afferents such as those from the cochlear nuclei
Despite the importance of the olivary pathways for binaural information processing, little is known about their synaptic organization in the colliculus
The present study investigates the structure of the projections from the lateral and medial superior olivary nuclei to the inferior colliculus at the electron microscopic level
The results show that the superior olivary complex contributes different patterns of synaptic input to the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus
Each projection from the superior olivary complex to the colliculus differs in the number and combinations of endings
Endings from medial superior olive terminate densely in the central nucleus
All endings from the contralateral lateral superior olive terminate much less densely than endings from the medial olive
These data show that the superior olive is a major contributor to the synaptic organization of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus
The ipsilateral projections of the medial and lateral superior olive may produce higher concentrations of R endings than other inputs to the central nucleus
Intracellular injection of Lucifer Yellow (LY) was used to study the detailed morphology of the normal visually deprived, and light-deprived superior colliculus projecting Type I retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in hamsters
We conclude that visual or light deprivation has no effect on the morphological development of superior colliculus projecting Type I retinal ganglion cells(RGCs) in hamsters, and the elimination of the transient features on the Type I retinal ganglion cells(RGCs) during development does not depend on visual experience or light stimulation
The concept of an early postnatal critical period of development for the lateral geniculate nucleus was assessed by determining in adult cats whether previously established properties of geniculate neurons could be altered by varying the cat's visual experience
To explore further the possibility that telencephalic neurons co-containing somatostatin(SS) and neuropeptide Y(NPY) may be evolutionarily conserved among amniotes, we determined the distribution and co-occurrence of somatostatin(SS) and neuropeptide Y(NPY) in forebrain neurons in pigeons
Double-label immunofluorescence studies revealed that in subdivisions of the telencephalon that are comparable to mammalian cortex (i
In contrast, within the basal telencephalon (including the basal ganglia and several other structures) neurons labeled only for neuropeptide Y(NPY) or only somatostatin(SS) were more abundant than those containing both neuropeptides
The morphology of single postsynaptic afferent fibers terminating in the feline cuneate nucleus was investigated by using transport of Phasolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin from the cervical spinal cord and intraaxonal injections of horseradish peroxidase into identified postsynaptic fibers in the cuneate fasciculus
Injections of Phaseolus in C5 and C6 of both rhizotomized and non-rhizotomized cats gave similar results and confirmed previous observations with other techniques
Anatomical and physiological studies indicate that the amino acid L-glutamate is the excitatory transmitter in sensory afferent pathways to the amygdala and in intraamygdala circuits involving the lateral and basal nuclei
In contrast, expression of the carboxy terminus segment Deletion I is prominent in the striatum but is not observed in other elements of the basal ganglia
NADPH-diaphorase-positive neurons have been demonstrated in the inner nuclear layer and ganglion cell layer of the retina of different mammalian species, but so far no experiments have been conducted to identify whether these cells are amacrine cells and/or retinal ganglion cells
Following unilateral optic nerve section, which leads to the retrograde degeneration of retinal ganglion cells, the numbers of both ND(g) and ND(i) cells did not change significantly for up to 4 months
In addition, when retinal ganglion cells were prelabeled retrogradely (horseradish peroxidase or fluorescent microspheres) and retinas were then stained for NADPH diaphorase, no double-labeled neurons were detected
The motor and sensory connections of the cervical vagus nerve and of its inferior ganglion (nodose ganglion) have been traced in the medulla oblongata of 32 adult cats with the neuroanatomical methods of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) histochemistry and amino acid autoradiography (ARG)
The histochemical and autoradiographic experiments showed that the vagus nerve enters the medulla from its lateral aspect in multiple fascicles and that it contains three major components--axons of preganglionic parasympathetic neurones, axons of skeletal motoneurons, and central processes of the sensory neurons in the nodose ganglion
Afferent fibers in the vagus nerve reached most of the subnuclei of the nTS bilaterally, with the more intense labeling being found on the ipsilateral side
The mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus is known to be a source of afferents which terminate in layer IV of prefrontal cortex
However, combined retrograde transport and immunohistochemical techniques failed to reveal the presence of cholecystokinin-positive neurons in the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus that project to prefrontal cortex
This distribution of immunoreactive structures suggests a distinctive role of cholecystokinin in cortical circuitry that is common to every region of prefrontal cortex
Most of the labelled somata are situated within three clusters: one below the lateral calyx and two in the anterior-ventral protocerebrum
Another point is that the numerical density of synapses in the dorsal horn is approximately that of the cerebral cortex
Cerebral cortex shows expression in several limbic areas at postnatal day 6(P6) 
In the hindbrain, cadherin-8 is expressed by several cranial nerve nuclei
When punctate injections of fast blue(FB) into the main olfactory bulb(MOB) are paired with restricted injections of a second fluorescent tracer (nuclear yellow or diamidino yellow dihydrochloride) into the appropriate sector of pars externa (pE) of the anterior olfactory nucleus, the punctate region of remote retrogradely labeled principal neurons is embedded within a topographically restricted longitudinal wedge of retrogradely labeled mitral and tufted cells that project extrinsically to or through pars externa(pE) 
The anatomical distribution of neurotensin perikarya and fibers in rat brain, spinal cord, and pituitary has been studied by immunohistochemistry
The content of large dense vesicles and synaptic associations with somata and proximal dendrites suggest that a certain proportion of the tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -containing terminals within the nucleus accumbens are morphologically distinct from catecholaminergic terminals within the dorsal striatum
Saccadic eye movements in the vertical plane are controlled by the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF) and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal
Injections of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into the area of the caudal central subdivision(CCS) revealed a distinctive subset of retrogradely labeled neurons located in the caudomedial portion of the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus(riMLF) 
Injections of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) that included this caudomedial rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus(riMLF) region anterogradely labeled axons that projected profusely throughout the caudal central subdivision(CCS) 
In summary, these results strongly suggest that the caudomedial part of the cat rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus(riMLF) is a premotor center that monosynaptically controls lid movements in conjunction with vertical saccades
The "early" cells were found in the forebrain at E32-E34 and settled in the extrahypothalamic area
USA 81:940-944, '84) have shown that the FMRFamide-immunoreactive (FMRFamide-ir) cells in the nucleus olfactoretinalis project to the retina
In older frey, tracers were used to fill retinopetal cells in both the nucleus olfactoretinalis and the diencephalon
Counts of these cells demonstrated that over one-third of the adult number of retinopetal cells in the nucleus olfactoretinalis are present and have axons in the retina when the fry is 9 days old, and the percentage grows to one-half by the time the fry is 1 month old
Development of the retinopetal cells in the diencephalon lags behind that of the cells in the nucleus olfactoretinalis
These results provide the first quantitative assessment of the synaptic architecture of thalamic somatic sensory relay neurons and show the basic organizational pattern exhibited by representatives of the physiological type of relay neurons most commonly encountered in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus(VPL) nucleus
A laminar cytoarchitectonic scheme of the lower thoracic and lumbosacral segments of the rat spinal cord is presented in which Rexed's principles for the cat are applied
Labeled neurons appeared bilaterally in the cervical and the thoracic cord following injections in the lumbosacral cord
In lamina V labeled neurons were distributed mainly laterally in the cervical cord but medially and laterally in the thoracic cord
In the upper cervical and the thoracic cord laminae VII and VIII neurons were distributed very densely along the lateral cord, accounting for 30 and 40 of the total labeled neurons, respectively
Neurons with crossed descending axons were found in laminae V, VII and VIII, in the medial part of lamina VII including the intermediomedial nucleus of the thoracic levels and close to the central canal
These neurons may function as the long spinal reflex paths for forelimb-hindlimb synergies and the intercalated paths between the supraspinal descending tracts and the spinal motor centers
The central axons of Type I spiral ganglion neurons travel in the auditory nerve and terminate in the cochlear nucleus
The ascending branches of these axons innervate the anteroventral cochlear nucleus and give rise to large axosomatic endings, called the endbulbs of Held, and smaller boutons
One site was always in the somatosensory cortex, and the other was in either the visual or the motor cortex
Stimulation of a single basal forebrain(BF) site often provoked similar release from the latter two cortical areas
Electrical stimulation of the basal forebrain(BF) also modified cortical neuronal activity
These data suggest an elaborate control of the sensory cortex by a mechanism involving both gamma-aminobutyric acid-containing and cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain(BF) 
In addition, accommodative responses to stimulation of the superior colliculus were compared before and after an injection of muscimol, an agonist of inhibitory neurotransmitter, into the pretectum
Mossy fibers, labeled by injections into the granule cell layer, terminated on parvalbumin neurons in the hilus and in CA3
It is well known that experimentally induced cochlear damage produces structural, physiological, and biochemical alterations in neurons of the cochlear nucleus
They also exhibited obvious abnormalities in the tectorial membrane, supporting cells, and Reissner's membrane throughout the cochlear duct and had complete inner and outer hair cell loss in the base
Although radial fibers emitting collaterals in the lateral segment and in the medial segment of the globus pallidus have been observed, it has not been possible to observe the same radial fiber emitting collaterals in both pallidal segments and the prospects of ever doing so are not good
The radial fibers in the medial segment of the globus pallidus are continuous with the "comb" bundle fibers and appear to be thinner than the radial fibers in the lateral segment of the globus pallidus
It is not proved; nonetheless, the view expressed here is that the radial fibers are thinner in the medial segment of the globus pallidus because they may be the same fibers that gave off collaterals in the lateral segment of the globus pallidus
The density of noradrenergic locus coeruleus projections and beta-adrenergic receptors in the main olfactory bulb of the rat increases with age
Changes in beta-adrenergic receptor density in response to both early learning and olfactory deprivation may be induced by a transient increase in olfactory bulb norepinephrine
At the same time, the pontine micturition center(PMC) elicits relaxation of the external urethral sphincter (EUS) by excitation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneurons in the sacral dorsal gray commissure (DGC), which, in turn, inhibit external urethral sphincter(EUS) motoneurons
The present study investigated, first, whether there are glycine immunoreactive interneurons in the sacral dorsal gray commissure(DGC) and, second, whether they receive direct pontine micturition center(PMC) afferents
In total 128 labeled pontine micturition center(PMC) terminals were found in the dorsal gray commissure(DGC) , which contained many round vesicles and asymmetric synapses
The results demonstrate that the pontine micturition center(PMC) projects directly to dendrites of interneurons in the sacral dorsal gray commissure(DGC) , which are immunoreactive for both glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) 
In keeping with the notion that the synaptic component of acetylcholine(ACh) transmission in cerebral cortex is preponderant in layer V, these quantitative data suggest a role for this innervation in the processing of cortical output as well as input
Extrapolation of particular features of this system in terms of total axon length and number of varicosities in whole cortex, length of axons and number of varicosities per cortically projecting neuron, and concentration of acetylcholine(ACh) per axon varicosity, should also help in arriving at a better definition of its roles and functional properties in cerebral cortex
Here, we define some of the features of the DL corticospinal tract(CST) by tracing corticospinal tract(CST) projections following injections of biotinylated dextran amine into the sensorimotor cortex, assessing the distribution of DL corticospinal tract(CST) axons and terminal arborizations in intact mice and in mice in which the main contingent of corticospinal tract(CST) axons in the dorsal column had been transected
Tracing of DL corticospinal tract(CST) axons in mice with selective lesions of the dorsal column revealed that DL corticospinal tract(CST) axons arborize extensively throughout the dorsal and ventral horns and that the overall territory that the DL corticospinal tract(CST) axons invade is similar to the territory innervated by the corticospinal tract(CST) axons in the main tract
In nasal retina, the ganglion cells had degenerated because they were axotomized by the optic chiasm section
Immunoreactivity was also seen in the cells of layers 2, 3A, 4B, 5, and 6 of area 17 and layers 3 and 5 of area 18
Subsequently, they lose their tangential orientation, enabling them to make contact with the axons of the olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) that innervate the whole olfactory bulb(OB) 
From here, cells extend around the caudal part of the ventromedial and dorsomedial nuclei and the base of the diencephalon
A corresponding dorsoventral asymmetry in myeloarchitecture supports the idea that V3 is an area that is restricted to dorsal extrastriate cortex and lacks a complete representation of the visual field
Transneuronal tracing techniques were used to identify the putative spinal and brainstem neurons involved in continence and voiding in the female rat
After both bladder base and bladder body injections, the majority of pseudorabies virus-labelled cells were found in the lateral gray and medial cord of L6-S1
A number of those found in the intermediolateral cell column resembled the parasympathetic preganglionic neurons; the remaining neurons in the lateral and medial gray were presumed to be interneurons
Several areas of the medullary reticular formation project mainly, and in some cases exclusively, to cervical and thoracic levels
Our results indicate that spinal projections from bulbar areas of the reticular formation are more complicated than previously supposed
In the olfactory bulbs, both the signal intensity and the number of positive cells were higher with the s GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) probe, whereas sb GnRH-associated peptide(GAP) mRNA-expressing cells were more numerous and intensely stained in the preoptic region
Additionally, the parabrachial region(PBR) may mediate more subtle changes in thalamic activity as attentional levels fluctuate during the waking state
In the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus(dLGN) and pulvinar nucleus, we quantitatively analyzed the distribution of muscarinic type 2(M2) receptors using electron microscopy
We tested this prediction by using quantitative techniques to compare the tangential distribution of callosal neurons in the striate cortex of strabismic cats to that in normally reared cats
Animals were rendered strabismic surgically at 8-10 days of age and were allowed to survive a minimum of 18 weeks, at which time multiple intracortical injections of the tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used to reveal the distribution of callosally projecting cells in the contralateral striate cortex
Although our data from strabismic cats do not differ markedly from those reported previously, we find that the distribution of callosal cells in the striate cortex of these cats does not differ significantly from that in our normally reared control cats
These results do not bear out the prediction that surgically shifting the visual axes leads to stabilization of juvenile callosal axons in anomalous places within the striate cortex
The retinal pigment epithelium(RPE) develops from the outer layer of the optic cup which by E45 consists of a multistratified epithelium
From the density of radiolabelled cells, and data on the overall density of retinal pigment epithelium(RPE) cells in the juvenile retina, we determined the labelling index
retinal pigment epithelium(RPE) cell genesis begins near the fovea, and proceeds towards the periphery
Cell division largely ceases in both foveal and perifoveal regions by E56, at which time labelled cells first begin to appear peripheral to the equator
A prolonged postnatal period of low density retinal pigment epithelium(RPE) cell genesis persists in both central and peripheral retina
Comparison of the pattern of expansion of the area containing radiolabelled cells in the retinal pigment epithelium(RPE) and neuroretina demonstrates a remarkable spatial and temporal correspondence
The posterior thalamic(Po) and parafascicular(Pf) were then dissected free and processed for electron microscopy by using standard methods
A survey of the general ultrastructure of posterior thalamic(Po) and parafascicular(Pf) revealed many RS profiles (small with round vesicles) making asymmetric synapses around single, small (distal; 0
There were no profiles making synapses on other vesicle-filled profiles seen, reflecting the scarcity of interneurons in the posterior thalamic(Po) and parafascicular(Pf) of rats
2 microm in diameter; n = 238), contained round vesicles, and made asymmetric synapses with proximal ( approximately 75%) and, to a lesser extent, distal ( approximately 25%) dendrites; they formed part of the RS population of the posterior thalamic(Po) and parafascicular(Pf) 
Somatosensory maps derived from multiunit microelectrode recordings revealed a complete somatosensory representation of the contralateral body surface within a large region of midrostral cortex (primary somatosensory cortex, or S1)
A second representation, the second somatosensory area (or S2), was found adjacent and caudolateral to S1 as a mirror image reversed along the representation of the glabrous snout
A reversal of somatotopic order and an enlargement of receptive fields marked the transition from S1 to S2
In the ventral telencephalon, radial glia, striatal, and migratory GABAergic neurons expressed CXCR4
Tangentially migrating CXCR4-expressing neurons populated the marginal zone and started to invade the lateral intermediate zone at embryonic day (E)14
During invasion of the cortical plate the orientation of CXCR4-immunoreactive neurons changed gradually from tangential (E17/E18) to radial (postnatal day [P] 0), which was paralleled by downregulation of SDF-1alpha in the intermediate/subventricular zone
In summary, SDF-1alpha is expressed along cortical but not subcortical migration routes of GABAergic neurons
Fibers fasciculate into bundles as they arise in the retina and reach the chiasma by NF Stage 32
Because the retina grows in rings at its margins, ganglion cell axons differentiate at the periphery and join the nearest fiber bundles (fascicles) to reach the optical disc
Wedges of ganglion cells send their axons into a common fascicle which retains its integrity as it leaves the retina at the optic disc
About 75 immunoreactive perikarya are grouped into clusters in the optic lobe and in the median and dorsal protocerebrum
Mushroom body stalks and lobes contain immunoreactive fibers arranged perpendicular to the Kenyon cell fibers and matching subcompartments of these corpora pedunculata areas
The shell surrounds the core and is defined by the terminal field of the nucleus angularis, one of the cochlear nuclei
The expression and localization of Vesicle associated membrane protein(VAMP) isoforms in the salamander retina, a major model system for studies of retinal circuitry, was examined by using immunocytochemical and immunoblotting methods
The early postnatal development of cholecystokinin-immunoreactive (CCK-ir) neurons was analyzed in visual areas 17 and 18 of cats aged from postnatal day 0 to adulthood
The first population consists of five cell types which appear perinatally in areas 17 and 18
The second population consists of two cell types which appear around the end of the second and during the third postnatal week in areas 17 and 18
Labeled PVCN cells, consisting of multipolar, octopus, and small spindle-shaped cells, were located in spatially restricted laminae stretching the entire rostrocaudal length of the nucleus, while labeled AVCN cells consisting of multipolar, globular, small spindle-shaped and small spherical cells were broadly distributed over the posterior half of the nucleus
Injections placed in the posterior half of the AVCN resulted in only very few labeled cells in the DCN
Cones containing both S and L/M opsin (S+L/M) appear around the fovea shortly after L/M opsin is expressed, are found in more peripheral retina at older ages, and decrease in number after birth
In this study, we examine the organization of the forebrain afferents to the parabrachial nucleus(PB) 
In general, forebrain areas tend to innervate the same parabrachial nucleus(PB) subnuclei from which they receive their input
Our results show that the forebrain afferents of the parabrachial nucleus(PB) are topographically organized
Early T-cell infiltration and microglial activation in periventricular and superficial white matter structures adjacent to meninges suggested initial recruitment of effector T cells via the cerebrospinal fluid and choroid plexus
Previous observations indicate that the basal forebrain receives dopaminergic input from the ventral midbrain
At the ultrastructural level, about 40% of the selected Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) -labeled presynaptic terminals in the ventral pallidum and substantia innominata were found to establish synaptic specializations with ChAT-containing profiles, most of which on the cell body and proximal dendritic shafts
Corresponding to the differences in the peripheral olfactory apparatus, the central olfactory projections were also asymmetric
The nucleus intercalatusspinalis and the dorsal commissural nucleus (between T13 and L2), both of which contain preganglionic neurons, are densely innervated
The results suggest that the paraventriculo-spinal pathway is particularly related to specific groups of sympathetic and parasympathetic preganglionic neurons, and to the marginal zone, whick is involved in the relay of ascending nociceptive information through the spinothalamic tract
In mouse and rat spinal cord, [(125)I]-deltorphin-labeled delta opioid receptors(DOR) binding sites were detected throughout the gray matter
The morphology and distribution of dopaminergic interplexiform cells in adult rat and monkey retinas were analyzed to determine any correlation with the function of dopamine in the outer retinal layers
Their density was higher in the superior retina than in the inferior retina of the rat and was especially high in the superior temporal quadrant
At embryonic day 12 (E12) in mice, the expression of Islet1(Isl1) marks distinctively the ventral portion of the nascent cochlear epithelium encompassing the primordial organ of Corti
In order to identify cytochemical traits relevant to understanding excitatory neurotransmission in brainstem auditory nuclei, we have analyzed in the dorsal cochlear nucleus the synaptic distribution of aspartate aminotransferase, glutamate, and vesicular zinc, three molecules probably involved in different steps of excitatory glutamatergic signaling
Neuropeptide Y ( Neuropeptide Y(NPY) ) at 10-1,000 nM caused a concentration-dependent, long-lasting reduction of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in the hippocampal subfield CA1 and the area dentata, and an even stronger reduction of population spikes
There is a dense innervation of CA1 by Neuropeptide Y(NPY) -immunoreactive axons and terminals, particularly in the stratum moleculare
Male rats were injected with True Blue into the dorsal vagal complex and with FluoroGold into the intermediolateral column of the lower thoracic spinal cord
Expression of c-Fos was prominent in several of the subnuclei of the paraventricular nucleus and in the adjacent perifornical nucleus
Neurones projecting to the spinal cord were prominent in the dorsal, lateral, and ventral portion of the medial parvicellular subnuclei of the PVN
Hardly any PVN neurones projecting to the dorsal vagal complex were concomitantly Fos-positive
A considerably larger (&amp;gt;10%) proportion of perifornical neurones projecting to the nucleus of the solitary tract were c-Fos-immunopositive
dopamine beta-hydroxylase(DBH) staining was confined to sparse networks of weakly fluorescent fibers with the highest numbers in the internal plexiform layer of the accessory olfactory bulb(AOB) and fewer fibers in the external plexiform, rostral, and granular layers of the main olfactory bulb(MOB) 
The subnuclei of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius(nTS) receiving baroreceptor and chemoreceptor afferents--dorsolateral and dorsal (dl and d) subnuclei of nucleus of the tractus solitarius(nTS) --showed scattered substance P immunoreactive nerve terminals
An important result of these experiments was the observation that regions of the medulla adjacent to the nucleus of the tractus solitarius(nTS) , i
Cells in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body were intracellularly labeled in brainstem tissue slices of two bat and two rodent species
The main cell type found in this nucleus, the principal cell, is an important link in the relay of ascending projections from the contralateral cochlear nucleus to the lateral superior olive, completing an essential pathway for sound localization
Although the dendrites of most labeled cells were confined to the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, some principal cells had dendrites that spread outside the nucleus to one of several adjacent periolivary cell groups
The periaqueductal gray(PAG) does not project directly to the motoneurons innervating the muscles involved in mating, but is thought to make use of the nucleus retroambiguus (NRA) as relay
The nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) is located ventrolaterally in the most caudal medulla, and projects directly to iliopsoas and cutaneus trunci motoneuronal cell groups
These results correspond with the hypothesis that in hamster the periaqueductal gray(PAG) - nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) -motoneuronal projection not only involves motoneurons of iliopsoas and cutaneus trunci but also of lateral longissimus(LL) and quadratus lumborum(QL) 
galanin-immunoreactive(GAL-IR) fibers were present in neurohypophyseal digitations of both the anterior and intermediate lobes with highest density in the region of the proximal pars distalis, where growth hormone and gonadotropic cells are located
On the ipsilateral side, these cells were located in the caudal portion of the ophthalmic-maxillary region and, less often, in the mandibular division
On the contralateral side, most labelled ganglion cells were visible in the anteromedial part of the ophthalmic-maxillary region but a few could also be seen in the mandibular division
) were made in different folia of the paramedian lobule of cats, and the sites of occurrence of labeled cells in the inferior olive were precisely determined
The phenomenon that following microinjections of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) in superficial parts of the folia labeled cells occur within parts only of the regions of the olive which contain labeled cells following large horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -injections in the paramedian lobule is discussed
Mormyrid fish showed the strongest immunoreactivity in the knollenorgan electroreceptor pathway; in the nucleus of the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) and the big cells of the nucleus exterolateralis pars anterior
In the electromotor system, two nuclei in the corollary discharge pathway showed labeling: in the paratrigeminal command-associated nucleus and the juxtalobar nucleus
The electromotor system showed labeling in the lateral relay nucleus and less strongly in the medullary relay nucleus, but none in the pacemaker
A discrete preganglionic cell column (column of Terni, CT) in the caudal thoracolumbar (segments 21-23) spinal cord is first discernible in a avian embryos on day 8 when it contains approximately 9,300 visceral motoneurons
Daily injections of nerve growth factor (NGF) (1-20 micrograms) on the chorioallantoic membrane from day 3 to day 9 produced a dose-dependent increase in both the volume of the caudal thoracolumbar sympathetic ganglia and the number of motoneurons in the corresponding CT on day 10
Nerve growth factor decreased the number of pyknotic (dying) neurons in both the thoracolumbar sympathetic ganglia and the corresponding CT on days 8 and 10
The increased number of neurons in both the thoracolumbar sympathetic ganglia and the corresponding CT following chronic administration of nerve growth factor(NGF) is the result of decreased cell death
Daily injections of nerve growth factor(NGF) (10-20 micrograms) from day 10 until day 14 increased the volume of (and the number of neurons in) the caudal thoracic sympathetic ganglia on day 15 but no effect on the number of motoneurons in the corresponding CT
In the toadfish utricle, glutamatergic hair cells are present throughout the macula
The first pathway arises from neurons which send axons to the contralateral medial longitudinal fasciculus (cMLF neurons); cMLF neurons show excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) after stimulation of the ipsilateral pontine gigantocellular tegmental field (PFTG)
No cMLF neurons with axon collaterals in the BFTG are present in the data of this study
About half of iBRF neurons have bifurcated axon collaterals with both anterior and posterior projections, and in these neurons antidromic spike potentials are elicited by stimulation of the ipsilateral PFTG
connexin family of proteins(Cx) 26 is also expressed in the CNS, primarily in the leptomeningeal linings, but is also reported in astrocytes and in neurons of developing brain and spinal cord
The trunk of the ALLN divides into dorsal and ventral roots as it enters the medulla
A portion of the ascending fibers continue more rostrally and terminate in the ipsilateral eminentia granularis and bilaterally in the cerebellar corpus
The ventral part of the peptide-positive area overlaps with the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra in which the TH-positive dendrites extend
Adult neurogenesis was also detected in the optic lobes but not in the antennal lobes
The first somatostatin immunoreactive somata in the lizard forebrain appeared on E36, and they were located in non cortical areas
Then, on E39 and later, somatostatin immunoreactive neurons were seen in the lizard cortex in a rostral-to-caudal spatial gradient, which parallels that of the normal histogenesis of the lizard cerebral cortex
On E39, labelled somata were seen in the medial and dorsal cortex inner plexiform layers; immunoreactive puncta and dendritic processes were detectable in the inner plexiform layer of the medial cortex
On P28, groups of labelled neurons appeared in the cell layer of dorsal and lateral cortices, reaching the adult-mature pattern of somatostatin immunoreactivity in the lizard cerebral cortex, i
Immunoreactive somata and processes occupied all the cortical areas, but they were especially abundant in the dorsomedial cortex
The most conspicuous finding regarding the location of slowly adapting lung stretch(SAR) terminals is that they are concentrated within specific subnuclear groups of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (nTS) and are distributed widely in the rostrocaudal plane of the medulla oblongata
The nucleus of the pontobulbar body (PBu) in the North American opossum is located, for the most part, adjacent to the motor root of the trigeminal nerve
Although there is some topography to such projections, it is not sharply defined and many regions of the pontobulbar body(PBu) contain labelled neurons after injections of horseradish peroxidase into widely separate areas of the cerebellar cortex
Because of its embryogenesis and position, the pontobulbar body(PBu) is often considered part of the dorsolateral basilar pons
Donor hypothalami were obtained from normal Long-Evans fetuses and transplanted to the lateral, third, or fourth ventricle of Brattleboro rats
Although suprachiasmatic nucleus(SCh) were identified in grafts recovered from each intraventricular transplantation site, an appreciable input to the host brain could be identified only when the fetal tissue was grafted to the third ventricle
An atlas of transverse sections of the globus pallidus and striatum was established in macaque with reference to ventricular coordinates
Both a personal case studied with autoradiography and data from literature were used to analyze the distribution of cortical axons into the striatum
Each pallidal dendritic disc is able to receive axons from a wide region of the striatum
Substance P-positive cells and processes were found in the optic tectum and in the visual Wulst
The area containing medial terminal nucleus(MTN) terminal fibers and the area occupied by nucleus of the optic tract(NOT) -IO neurons has been found to match
Intracerebroventricular infusions of nerve growth factor(NGF) into the third ventricle adjacent to the preoptic area resulted in a 58% increase in relative cellular levels of trkA mRNA in the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca(DBB) 
These data provide evidence that both p75 nerve growth factor(NGF) R and trkA are expressed by nerve growth factor(NGF) -responsive neurons in the medial septum(MS) and diagonal band of Broca(DBB) 
The focal regions of activity occurred in pairs involving both medial and lateral representations in the bulb, perhaps reflecting the paired medial and lateral projections of olfactory sensory neurons expressing specific types of odorant feature receptor proteins
Serial section electron microscopy has been used to examine a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labelled group Ia afferent collateral from its entry point in the grey matter to its termination in Clarke's column of the cat spinal cord
The results suggest that the dorsal and ventral respiratory groups form an extensively interconnected neuronal system receiving convergent inputs from the same brainstem nuclear groups, consistent with the hypothesis that the dorsal and ventral groups are primarily sites for integration of sensory and premotor respiratory drive inputs
Understanding the interaction of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum requires knowledge of the highly complex spatial characteristics of cerebro-cerebellar signal transfer
This non-overlapping distribution is consistent with a compartmentalized organization of the cerebro-pontine projection and may be the basis of the fractured type of maps found in the cerebellar granular layer
This matches the diameter of dendritic trees of layer 5 projection neurons, indicating that non-overlapping populations of neocortical projection neurons possess non-overlapping patches of pontine terminals
Because the calbindin-rich and -poor regions of P(3) corresponded to differential patterns of cortical connectivity, the results suggest that calbindin(CB) may further delineate functional subdivisions in the pulvinar
Caudally, the nucleus consists of a small number of loosely aggregated neurons lying lateral to the ventral periaqueductal gray matter at a rostrocaudal level corresponding to the rostral one-fifth of the somatic cell columns of the oculomotor nucleus
Rostrally, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal(INC) increases in size and reaches its maximum development in its rostral half, where it lies ventrolateral to the nucleus of Darkschewitsch (ND)
Injections of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) into lesions at cervical, thoracic, or lumbar levels of the spinal cord resulted in retrograde labelling of neurons of all sizes and shapes throughout the entire length of the interstitial nucleus of Cajal(INC) 
However, the greatest number of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) -labelled cells in interstitial nucleus of Cajal(INC) were observed subsequent to injections of the enzyme into cervical levels of the cord
Following injections of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) into the inferior olive only small to medium-sized neurons were labelled in the nucleus, the majority of which are located in rostral levels of the interstitial nucleus of Cajal(INC) 
The sizes of the projections from these two nuclei to the inferior olive appeared to be much larger than that from the interstitial nucleus of Cajal(INC) 
Smaller numbers of neurons were also observed in the rostral parvocellular red nucleus (RN) and mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF)
The tectal gray has predominantly ascending projections to the diencephalon
The tectal gray also projects topographically to layers 4 and 8-13 of the optic tectum
In the 2-deoxyglucose(2-DG) experiments, bats presented with second harmonic frequency modulated(FM) stimuli alone showed uptake of label in specific regions of the central nucleus and dorsal cortex of the inferior colliculus, and the nucleus of the brachium
We combined immunoperoxidase labeling of the anterograde tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHAL) with immunogold-silver labeling of tyrosine hydroxylase to determine whether this enzymatic marker for catecholamines was present in efferents from the area postrema or their targets in the rat nucleus tractus solitarii(NTS) 
At survival periods of 10-12 days after Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHAL) injections into the area postrema, light microscopy revealed numerous varicose processes containing peroxidase reaction product for Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHAL) in the dorsomedial, medial, and commissural nucleus tractus solitarii(NTS) 
We conclude that a few catecholamine, but mainly noncatecholamine efferents from the area postrema provide a monosynaptic, and most likely inhibitory input to target neurons both with and without tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the dorsomedial and commissural nucleus tractus solitarii(NTS) 
Synapses between the efferent terminals from the area postrema and tyrosine hydroxylase labeled and unlabeled dendrites as well as unlabeled axons in these specific subnuclei of the nucleus tractus solitarii(NTS) suggest multiple sites for modulation of gastric and cardiovascular reflexes in response to circulating peptides
Confocal three-dimensional reconstructions revealed clusters of postsynaptic density(PSD) s along proximal dendrites of transfected pyramidal neurons in area CA3, but not in CA1
Examination of Golgi-impregnated specimens demonstrates that the Ju has precise boundaries primarily determined by a conical condensation of fibers of the stria terminalis (StT) around the nucleus
Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) injections into layers IV, V, and VI reveal widespread efferent projections to all of the more superficially located layers of the medial entorhinal area(MEA) in addition to projections to the lateral EA
Taken together, the findings of the present experiments suggest that (1) all layers of the medial entorhinal area(MEA) have longitudinal projections directed primarily toward the ventral (or temporal) part of this cortex, (2) the projections of layers II and III are relatively restricted compared of the deeper layers
Cells of the corpus striatum arise from the lateral ganglionic eminence of the telencephalic neuroepithelium
Two principal conclusions are drawn: Progenitors at the different rostrocaudal levels are heterogeneous with regard to the pattern of cellular proliferation, and ganglionic progenitors are in advance of the cerebral cortical progenitors based on the relative size of the secondary proliferative population and the magnitude of cytokinetic parameters
To follow on a recent quantitative study of the developing cholinergic (ACh) innervation in rat neocortex, axon varicosities identified by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry with a highly sensitive antibody against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) were examined in the primary somatosensory area (Par1) of rats at postnatal ages (days) P8, P16, and P32
In the present study some afferent, commissural, and efferent connections of the vestibular nuclear complex in the turtle Pseudemys scripta elegans were demonstrated with the HRP tracing technique
Distinct commissural projections appeared to arise in the dorsolateral, ventromedial, and descending vestibular nuclei
The commissural projection arising in the ventrolateral vestibular nucleus appeared to be only sparsely developed
The ascending vestibulo-oculomotor projection was found to be organized in an ipsilateral pathway arising in the dorsolateral vestibular nucleus and in a contralateral pathway, arising mainly in the medial vestibular nucleus
Finally, several neurons in the lumbar enlargement were labeled retrogradely with FluoroRuby after injections into the nucleus raphe obscurus(nRO) and the immediately adjacent reticular formation
At the light microscopic level, calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) -like immunoreactive ( calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) -I) fibers and substance P(SP) -like immunoreactive ( substance P(SP) -I) fibers were found to pass through the lateral edge of the dorsal horn and then into the dorsal region of the sacral intermediolateral nucleus
In addition, substance P(SP) -I fibers also extend from the dorsolateral funiculus into the entire sacral intermediolateral region
For example, LAR mRNA is highly expressed by both proliferating and postmitotic cells in the cerebral cortex at embryonic day 17 and in all layers of the cortex at postnatal day 4
To better understand the role played by SCG10 and stathmin in vivo, we have analyzed the expression and localization of these proteins in both the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb in developing and adult rats, as well as in adult bulbectomized rats
In the olfactory bulb of postnatal and adult rats, a moderate to strong SCG10 immunoreactivity was present in the olfactory nerve layer, whereas no labeling was detected in the glomerular layer
In this study we assessed synapse density within the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex of Tg2576 mice at 6-18 months of age using stereological methods at both the light and electron microscope levels
Under light microscopy we failed to find overall decreases in the density of synaptophysin-positive boutons in any brain areas selected, but bouton density was significantly decreased within 200 mum of compact beta-amyloid plaques in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and Layers II and III of the entorhinal cortex at 15-18 months of age in Tg 2576 mice
Under electron microscopy, we found overall decreases in synapse density in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus at both 6-9 and 15-18 months of age, and in Layers II and III of the entorhinal cortex at 15-18 months of age in Tg 2576 mice
These results provide the first quantitative morphological evidence at the ultrastructure level of a spatial relationship between beta-amyloid plaques and synapse loss within the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex of Tg2576 mice
The morphology of 11 dorsal respiratory group (DRG) inspiratory neurons located in the ventrolateral nucleus of the solitary tract (vl-NTS) was studied using the technique of intracellular labeling with the enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
The aberrant projection arises as a vertically directed branch from the contralaterally traveling NM axon at the medial border of nucleus laminaris (NL)
A cytoarchitectonic parcellation has been made of the cortex of the insula and of the adjoining parts of the temporal and parietal lobes in rhesus and squirrel monkeys
In the "second" and "third" sensory areas, such as the second somatic sensory and many of the auditory fields, the density of the plexus and its coarseness diminish slightly and the deeper half of layer IV becomes free of terminals
,in areas 3b and AI) there is labeling of the superficial half of layer VI
Where layers V and VI become subdivided in the homotypical cortex, the auditory and adjacent fields were only observed in cases in which the magnocellular nucleus of the medial geniculate body was involved by the injection of isotope
The boundaries of the cortical projection fields of individual thalamic nuclei, as determined autoradiographically, are remarkably sharp and invariably coincide with a sharp architectonic boundary or with a zone of maximal cytoarchitectonic change
As early as stage 33, nitrergic cells were observed in the caudal rhombencephalon within the developing inferior reticular nucleus
Tectal tissue was dissected from fetal rats and transplanted adjacent to the superior colliculus of newborn rats
The projection from host cortex (particularly from visual cortical areas) was the densest and most consistent projection
The frontal lobe connections of different architectonic areas of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) in the rhesus monkey were investigated with the aid of both anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques
The mid-portion of polymodal cortex projects to, and receives fibers from, rostral subdivisions of lateral prefrontal cortex, viz
On the other hand, the scatter of fibers from the foveal and parafoveal areas progressed gradually through the nerve
However, the temporal central retinal fibers were located in the lateral periphery of the nerve, and they overlapped significantly with fibers from the temporal peripheral retina
Thus, the present findings based on more precise anatomical techniques indicate that the classical notion of the retinal quadrant topography in the monkey optic nerve probably is suspect
Mean total cell labeling was less than 400 per spinal segment, suggesting recruitment from a very small fraction of the neurons contained within the spinal cord (calculated at &amp;lt; 0
The mitral cell of the olfactory bulb is the primary relay neuron that transmits information from the olfactory receptors to the rest of the brain
In vitro olfactory bulb neurons and their dendrites from embryonic day (E) 18 olfactory bulbs responded to t-ACPD and quisqualate, selective and nonselective metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists, and to several ionotropic glutamate agonists with increases in intracellular Ca2+ as studied with fura-2 digital imaging
The pretectum displays the most intense expression of parvalbumin within the diencephalon
We compare the distribution of calcium-binding proteins in the diencephalon of Psammodromus with other vertebrates, with mammals in particular, and suggest that the middle and ventral tiers of the reptilian dorsal thalamus may be comparable to nonspecific or plurimodal posterior/intralaminar thalamic nuclei in mammals, on the basis of the calcium-binding protein expression patterns, as well as the hodological and embryological data in the literature
The efferent connections of different cytoarchitectonic areas of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) in the rhesus monkey with parieto-temporo-occipital cortex were investigated using autoradiographic methods
Bulbar reticular fields, in addition, were identified according to their cells of origin and the laterality of their spinal projections after injection of tracer
Faint projections were demonstrated to the nucleus of the posterior commissure and the nucleus of Darkschewitsch
Unlike the sensorimotor apparatus controlling limb and body movements, the brainstem regions controlling the head and neck received prominent cortical projections
There is a correlation between axon number and mitral/tufted cell number during larval development that is consistent with the hypothesis that olfactory axons influence olfactory bulb development
We have now investigated whether a sciatic nerve crush injury alters the behavioral response in rats to tactile stimuli and whether this is associated with a change in the pattern of c-Fos expression in the dorsal horn and the parabrachial area of the brainstem
C-Fos expression in the dorsal horn and parabrachial region was never observed on brushing the skin of the sciatic nerve territory in animals with intact nerves, but was found after sciatic nerve crush with peripheral regeneration
We conclude that after nerve injury, low threshold mechanoreceptor fibers may play a major role in producing pain-related behavior by activating normally nociceptive-specific regions of the central nervous system such as the superficial laminae of the dorsal horn and the parabrachial area
We have examined the circuitry connecting the posterior parietal cortex with the frontal lobe of rhesus monkeys
HRP-WGA and tritiated amino acids were injected into subdivisions 7m, 7a, 7b, and 7ip of the posterior parietal cortex, and anterograde and retrograde label was recorded within the frontal motor and association cortices
Our main finding is that each subdivision of parietal cortex is connected with a unique set of frontal areas
Here we show that relatively mature neurons generated from neurospheres derived from postnatal subependymal zone or cerebellar cortex undergo a phenotypic transformation into astrocytes that coincides with the appearance of a nonfused, hybrid cell type that shares the morphology, antigenicity, and physiology of both neurons and astrocytes
The distribution of terminal projections in the brainstem from lamina I neurons in the spinal dorsal horn was investigated with the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin in the cat and the cynomolgus monkey
These observations indicate that spinal lamina I neurons project to a variety of brainstem sites involved in autonomic (cardiovascular, respiratory) and homeostatic processing and the control of behavioral state
The genetically determined loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) in "Purkinje cell degeneration" (pcd) mutant mice deprives inferior olivary (IO) neurons of their major postsynaptic target
The medial accessory olive (MAO) appeared less affected than the principal (PO) and the dorsal accessory olive (DAO)
Motoneurons innervating the palatoglossus are located in the nucleus ambiguus and, possibly, in dorsolateral hypoglossal nucleus regions
At the end of various survival periods following unilateral removal of the retina, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was administered to the optic nerve stump by a fiber-filling method
However, approximately 55,000 normal-appearing unmyelinated axons (12% of the unmyelinated fiber population) persisted in the optic nerve at 10 weeks following removal of the retina
It is hypothesized that the potential shown by frog optic axons for long-term survival in the absence of the cell-body expresses a general property of vertebrate (and invertebrate) axons, rather than a special property of the frog optic nerve
Short-survival, sequential, and long-survival thymidine radiograms of rat embryos, fetuses and young pups were analyzed in order to delineate the boundaries of the proliferative thalamic neuroepithelium, describe its early transformations, identify its regional divisions, and, finally, attempt to relate its distinct neuroepithelial components to specific thalamic nuclei that they supply with neurons
In this introductory paper, some evidence is presented in support of the hypothesis that the identified thalamic sublobules represent putative cell lines committed to produce neurons for specific, early-generated thalamic nuclei
The early derivatives of the intermediate lobule are the sublobules of the ventrolateral and ventrobasal nuclei
The early derivatives of the reticular lobule and reticular protuberance are the sublobules of the reticular nuclear complex
Thus these data indicate a previously unrecognized topographic representation of the vertical dimension of the spiral ganglion across ventral cochlear nuclei(VCN) isofrequency laminae
In the present study, we investigated the ultrastructure and synaptic targets of hippocampal terminals, as well as their relation to dopamine(DA) terminals within the prefrontal cortex(PFC) of adult rats
Hippocampal afferents were labeled either by anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) from the ventral hippocampal formation or by anterograde degeneration following fimbria lesion
Hippocampal terminals in the prefrontal cortex(PFC) , identified by either method, formed primarily asymmetric axospinous synapses, with a small percentage forming asymmetric axodendritic synapses
Thus, the contralateral (to the enucleated eye) colliculi showed a decrease, whereas the ipsilateral colliculi showed an increase in the synapse-to-neuron ratio compared with light-reared, nonenucleated rats
When enucleated rats were reared in the raised in either "light" or "dark"(red light) , there was a decrease in the ratio in both colliculi, although the extent of this decrease was more marked in the contralateral than the ipsilateral colliculi
By five days of age the caudal region exhibiting a long-lasting degeneration reaction extends from the middle of the olfactory tubercle to the middle of the amygdala
Examination of thick serial sections and surface preparations with the differential interference contrast microscope (Nomarski optics) allowed direct visualization of individually impregnated spiral ganglion cells, complete with their peripheral processes and endings in the organ of Corti
There are at least two types of spiral ganglion cells in the cochlea of the infant cat and rat
Hence, these ganglion cells establish nearly "point-to-point" connections between the auditory nerve and the organ of Corti
The vagal potential underwent a phase reversal in the middle layers; thus, the current sink site was cytoarchitectonically identified as the most rostral part of the parietal granular cortex or the S1, where no somatosensory input has previously been demonstrated
Double-labeling experiments show that the projections of the subesophageal-calycal tract(SCT) neurons do not overlap with the projections of the olfactory projection neurons and visual projection neurons from the dorsal medulla
Neurons in the lateral superior olive are optimally excited by stimulation of the ipsilateral ear, as are those in the inferior colliculus by stimulation of the contralateral ear
Thus, there is a heavy uncrossed projection from the cat lateral superior olive to the inferior colliculus that may be glycinergic and inhibitory
Positive fibers were also seen in the median eminence and in the neural lobe of the pituitary
The axons of the primary sensory olfactory neurons project from the olfactory neuroepithelium lining the nasal cavity, onto glomeruli covering the surface of the olfactory bulb
The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that phenotypically unique subsets of primary sensory olfactory neurons, scattered throughout the nasal cavity, project to a subset of glomeruli in specific olfactory bulb loci
These data demonstrated that a phenotypically distinct subset of primary sensory olfactory neurons exhibits a topographical projection from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb, and suggests that these, and other subsets, may form the basis of the mosaic nature of this pathway
Moreover, it appears that the outer nerve fibre layer in the rostral olfactory bulb plays an important instructive role in the guidance and fasciculation of olfactory sensory axons
In monkeys monocularly treated with tetrodotoxin for 1 day to 2 weeks, both Nuclear respiratory factor 2(NRF-2) alpha expression and c oxidase(CO) activity were reduced in deprived ocular dominance columns of the visual cortex and in deprived layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus
basic fibroblast growth factor(bFGF) stimulated DNA synthesis by 68% in hippocampus, and by &amp;gt; 250% in pontine subventricular zone (SVZ)
In contrast, incorporation was not altered in basal pons or cerebral cortex, regions in which neurogenesis has already ceased
These results suggest that the specific vibrissal thalamocortical pathway sets up an excitatory synaptic activity in the cortex of the irradiated animal
In contrast to the strong innervation of locus coeruleus and raphe in mammal, the melanin-concentrating hormone(MCH) and hypocretin systems in goldfish barely innervate these aminergic populations related to the regulation of sleep and arousal
melanin-concentrating hormone(MCH) , but not hypocretin, immunoreactive fibers terminate substantially in the sensory layer of the vagal gustatory lobe of goldfish, while both peptidergic systems distribute to the primary visceral sensory areas of the medulla and pons
In the paraventricular organ(PVO) , Noradrenaline-immunoreactive(NAi) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting neurons are located in the same regions where dopamine- and serotonin-containing cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) contacting neurons occur
Interestingly, Noradrenaline-immunoreactive(NAi) fibers form large club endings in some subdivisions of the precerebellar nucleus lateralis valvulae, and parallel fibers in the cerebellar granular layer
Comparison with the distribution of Noradrenaline-immunoreactive(NAi) or dopamine-beta-hydroxylase-immunoreactivity in other species shows that all teleosts studied to date have noradrenergic cells in the locus coeruleus and the caudal rhombencephalon
However, Noradrenaline-immunoreactive(NAi) cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) -contacting paraventricular organ(PVO) cells have been described only in the teleost Gnathonemus petersii and the lizard Gekko gecko (Smeets and Steinbusch: J
It is possible that they might pick up catecholamines as well as serotonin from the cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) , into which monoamines might be released by telencephalic and preoptic subependymal axonal plexuses
Compared with workers, they all have large eyes, relatively larger optic lobes, smaller mushroom bodies, and similarly sized antennal lobes
The input regions of the mushroom bodies, the lip and the collar, generally correlate with the size of the optic and antennal lobe, respectively
For instance, the lateroposterior nucleus and pulvinar (LP-PUL) mostly contained thick axons that contributed clusters of large-sized varicosities, each forming multiple asymmetric synapses, usually with vesicle-filled dendrites
Because the caudate nucleus does not project to the thalamus, this labeling had to arise from a neuronal population with branching axons to both structures
Previous findings pointed to three possible sources: brainstem monoaminergic cells, intralaminar thalamic neurons, and corticostriatal cells
Therefore, we concluded that the thalamic anterograde labeling originated from corticostriatal neurons, with axons branching to the thalamus
A systematic representation of the contralateral body surface was found in lateral parietal cortex adjoining the first somatosensory representation, SmI (Sur et al
The representation of the body in SmII was found to be much less distorted than in SmI
" This orientation allows SmII and SmI to be adjoined along a common border representing the top of the head and face
After iontophoretic deposits of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) in the area of the rostral ventral respiratory group(rVRG) , many biotinylated dextran amine(BDA) -labeled terminals in the ventral horn of cervical spinal cord (C4-C5) were immunoreactive for enkephalin and vesicular glutamate transporter-2(VGLUT2) 
Thus, we have studied the membrane availability and intraneuronal distribution of the m2 muscarinic autoreceptor (m2R) in cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) projecting to the frontal cortex (FC)
The cerebello-pulvinar fibers were found to arise mainly from the parvicellular region of the lateral cerebellar nucleus and to terminate contralaterally in a narrow area at the extreme dorsolateral edge of the pulvinar nucleus(Pul) at the level of the stereotaxic frontal plane A-7
The area of terminal ramification of retino-pulvinar fibers was seen as a thin sheet lying at the extreme lateral edge of the pulvinar nucleus(Pul) through most of the rostrocaudal extent of the pulvinar nucleus(Pul) , bilaterally with contralateral predominance
The cerebellorecipient area in the pulvinar nucleus(Pul) did not seem to overlap with the retinorecipient pulvinar nucleus(Pul) area; the former appeared to be contiguous ventrolaterally to the latter
Collectively, these findings indicate that glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the zebrafish olfactory bulb(OB) and that ionotropic glutamate receptor(iGluR) subtypes function heterogeneously in the bulbar neurons
Pyramidal neurons in the mouse SmI cortex were labeled by the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) injected into the ipsilateral MsI cortex
To avoid confusion, terminals in SmI cortex labeled by the anterograde transport of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) injected into MsI were eliminated by lesion-induced degeneration
Although the descending projections were bilateral with an ipsilateral dominance, trigeminal sensory nuclear complex(TSNC) received a more dominant ipsilateral projection than spinal dorsal horn(SpDH) 
The ipsilateral portion of the nucleus nervi oculomotorii, which is located in the rostral ventral tegmentum mesencephali, supplies the musculi recti inferior and medialis and the musculus obliquus inferior without a clear somatotopic representation of the motoneurons
The nucleus nervi trochlearis, which rostrally joins the nucleus nervi oculomotorii with a gap of only about 40 micron between the nuclei, is situated completely contralateral to the musculus obliquus superior supplied by it
Dendrites of the nucleus nervi oculumotorii and of the nucleus accessorius nervi abducentis extend into neuropil areas receiving primary sensory afferents
Adult rat spinal and brainstem motoneurons re-express low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (p75) after their axotomy
Results of these previous studies differed regarding the type of the most effective triggering injury for p75 reexpression, the relative duration of this reexpression and the decrease of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity (-IR) following a permanent axotomy of spinal or brainstem motoneurons
This evidence indicates that spinal and brainstem motoneurons respond to a permanent axotomy with a different modulation of p75 and choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) expression
In colchicine-treated turtles and pigeons, numerous calcitonin-gene-related peptide(CGRP) + perikarya were observed in the auditory relay nucleus of the thalamus (n
Injections of fluorogold into the auditory cortex combined with immunofluorescence labeling for calcitonin-gene-related peptide(CGRP) revealed that calcitonin-gene-related peptide(CGRP) + cells in these areas do, in fact, project to the auditory cortices
These include the possibility that auditory thalamic projections to the telencephalon arose independently in the lines of evolution leading to mammals and sauropsids
Dual immunostaining for Fluoro-Gold (FG) and ER alpha or Fluoro-Gold(FG) and androgen receptors(AR) showed that over one-third of medial preoptic(MPO) efferents to the periaqueductal gray(PAG) contain receptors for either estrogen or androgen
In addition, approximately 50% of periaqueductal gray(PAG) neurons retrogradely labeled from the nucleus paragigantocellularis(nPGi) were immunoreactive for either ER alpha or androgen receptors(AR) 
An analysis of the results demonstrates that the projection to the midline cortex arises in the medial neurons within the caudal two-thirds of the basolateral nucleus
This projection is directed to the anterior cingulate cortex, but not to the posterior cingulate cortex
The primary motor cortex receives a basolateral amygdala projection which originates from neurons in two areas, (1) the medial part of the anterior one-third of the nucleus and (2) the center (in the lateral to medial axis) portion of the posterior two-thirds of the nucleus
These results demonstrate that the basolateral nucleus gives rise to a rather widespread and topographically organized projection to the anterior half of the neocortex of the rat
Some of the fine fibers in the medial lateral cervical nucleus(LCN) appeared to be collaterals of thicker fibers that terminated in the lateral lateral cervical nucleus(LCN) 
The labeling was more sparse than that observed in the medial lateral cervical nucleus(LCN) after larger dorsal horn injections but displayed the same morphological characteristics
The Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) observations were corroborated by the presence of many retrogradely labeled lamina I cells at both cervical and lumbar spinal levels, following injections of cholera toxin subunit b or rhodamine-labeled microspheres in the medial lateral cervical nucleus(LCN) 
These observations indicate that the medial part of the lateral cervical nucleus(LCN) receives input from lamina I neurons, and probably from lamina III-V neurons as well, at cervical and lumbar spinal levels
The lamina I input could also be responsible for the general inhibition of lateral lateral cervical nucleus(LCN) neurons by wide-field noxious stimulation, via activation of GABAergic interneurons in the medial lateral cervical nucleus(LCN) 
This study examined the morphology of individual retinogeniculate terminals that were filled with horseradish peroxidase by injections in the optic tract or optic tectum
These immunoreactive cells move outside the olfactory organ to form the ganglion of the nervus terminalis
This may be exerted by neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus(PVH) with spinal projections
In this study, we have analyzed the distribution of spinal cord-projecting paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus(PVH) neurons that express vasopressin, an important neuropeptide in autonomic regulation
More than 40% of the spinally projecting neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus(PVH) of naive Sprague-Dawley rats were found to express vasopressin mRNA
The magnocellular subdivisions displayed large numbers of vasopressin mRNA-expressing neurons, but very few of those projected to the spinal cord
The dorsal parvocellular subdivision contained a large number of spinally projecting neurons, but very few of those expressed vasopressin mRNA
This provides an anatomical basis for a selective activation of functionally different groups in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus(PVH) as part of a behaviorally adaptive response, including modulation of autonomic activity and pain processing at the spinal level
Brain sections cut parallel to the cortical surface revealed myelin-light septa that isolated representations of the digits and parts of the face, teeth, and tongue in area 3b of adult and infant macaque monkeys
A system of periodic intrinsic connections is demonstrated in area V2 (area 18) of squirrel and macaque monkeys by large injections of tritiated amino acids, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and fluorescent latex beads
As in V1, the tangential configuration of these connections in V2 is reticular or latticelike, and is detectable for 2
Other extrinsic connections, however, such as backgoing connections from V2 to V1, do not seem to have a periodic distribution
Retrograde tracer deposits into the visual recipient zone of the caudate nucleus reveal substantial convergence of other cortical inputs to this same domain
Aspects of visuotopic organization are preserved in the visual projections to both the putamen and the caudate nucleus, but unequivocal retinotopic organization could not be inferred from the available material
Ten of the eleven extrastriate visual area also project topographically onto the visual zone of the claustrum
"Omnipause" neurons (OPNs), located in the nucleus raphe pontis and the reticular formation, actively suppress saccadic eye movements during intersaccadic intervals
To determine the brainstem afferents that may inhibit the OPNs and thereby allow a saccade to occur, we injected horseradish peroxidase into the raphe pontis of four cats at the site of physiologically identified OPNs
A few neurons were labeled in a restricted region of the causal part of the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi and in the nucleus reticularis medullaris ventralis
Larger numbers of neurons were labeled in the dorsal column nuclei and in parts of the cochlear nuclei
The best prospects for a saccade initiation signal from one of the labeled populations appear to be the meso-diencephalic reticular formation and/or the superior colliculus
In the present study, we investigated the expression profiles and activity levels of ligands and receptors of the Transforming growth factor-beta(TGF-beta) and bone morphogenetic protein(BMP) 4 family during the physiological programmed cell death(PCD) periods of the developing chick and mouse retina and possible interactions of both proapoptotic molecules in mediating apoptosis in chick and murine retinal whole-mount cultures
Retrograde transganglionic transport of HRP revealed somatotopy within the brainstem facial lobe: the delicate nerve fibres innervating the chemosensory anterior dorsal fin terminate exclusively in a distinct, dorsal portion of the facial lobe
Antisera to GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase) and GABA were used to determine the distribution of GABAergic cells and terminals in the brainstem and midbrain auditory nuclei of the barn owl
In the time pathway, all the cells of the cochlear nucleus magnocellularis and nucleus laminaris receive perisomatic GABAergic terminals, and small numbers of GABAergic neurons surround both nuclei
Temporal lobe epilepsy is often associated with pathological changes in the dentate gyrus, and such changes may be more common in humans than in some nonprimate species
These noradrenergic projection neurons were located not only in the locus ceruleus (8%) but also in the lateral tegmentum, including the A5 (4%) and A7 (2%) cell groups
We examined the morphology and distribution of retrogradely labeled spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons in lamina I (the marginal zone) of the spinal dorsal horn after large injections of cholera toxin subunit B (CTb) or Fast Blue (FB) into the contralateral thalamus of cats
Degeneration experiments reveal that the vestibular nerve of the adult opossum distributes to an extensive and diverse area of the brainstem and, as in placental mammals, the traditionally named nuclei do not receive a uniform distribution of primary afferent fibers
The growth of regenerating retinal axons into the central portion of the optic tectum of adult goldfish was examined with the light and electron microscopes
Regenerating axons appear in very large numbers and travel in fascicles in the stratum opticum (SO) and in the adjacent neuropil, the stratum fibrosum et griseum superficiale (SFGS)
The course of the accessory optic tract (AOT) and the retinal projection to the terminal nuclei are described in the gibbon and compared to that of other mammals
In contrast to previous reports in haplorhine primates, which describe the accessory optic system(AOS) as consisting of only the dorsal (DTN) and the lateral (LTN) terminal nuclei, we find that in the gibbon, three cellular groups receive a bilateral projection, predominantly from the contralateral retina
According to cytoarchitecture and topographic location, two of these nuclei correspond to the DTN and the LTN
There was no evidence for a ventral division of the medial terminal nucleus(MTN) , which in nonprimates is typically situated at the ventromedial base of the cerebral peduncle
Examination of brain morphology in primates suggests that the ventral division of the medial terminal nucleus(MTN) has been displaced from its phylogenetically stable location in the medial part of the ventral midbrain to a more dorsal position
Nucleus basalis projects upon a belt of neurons within the overlying neostriatum
NCT projects, in turn, upon a region of archistriatum intermedium containing cell bodies of the occipito-mesencephalic tract
7) in the thalamus and hypothalamus of the rat were studied by means of a pharmaco-histochemical technique involving staining for acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) (Karnovsky-Roots' procedure) at various times after administration of bis-(u-methylethyl)phosphorofluoridate
The strongest acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) activity occurring at the level of the thalamus is found within the small, round to oval, somata of nucleus anterior dorsalis
Most of the intralaminar nuclei, as well as nucleus reticularis, are composed of medium-sized multipolar neurons displaying moderate to strong acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) activity
Moderately stained acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) neurons are also found in pars ventralis of nucleus geniculatus lateralis and in pars lateralis of nucleus habenularis
At the level of the hypothalamus, the neurons of nuclei supraoptics and paraventricularis show strong acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) activity
The acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) neurons of nucleus supraopticus are surrounded by numerous acetyl cholinesterase(AChE) -containing processes of some large lateral preoptic area neurons that stain intensely for the enzyme
Retrograde tracing, with either horse-radish peroxidase or rhodamine-labelled microspheres, indicated a significant increase in the number of neurons projecting to the rostral striatum from the dorsal raphe nucleus of lesioned animals
The increase was largely confined to the rostral extent of the dorsal raphe, and overlapped the distribution of cells labelled after injections of HRP into caudal striatum of control and lesioned animals
These findings demonstrate that removal of dopamine(DA) afferents during development leads to an enlargement of the serotoninergic projection from the raphe nucleus to the striatum
Specifically, trkB and neurotrophin-3(NT-3) mRNA elevations were restricted to granule cells in the ipsilateral dentate gyrus, whereas bilateral increases in trkC, brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) , and nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA levels occurred in granule cells and hippocampal pyramidal cells
Golgi-impregnated, linearized hippocampi were sectioned serially in one of the three hippocampal planes
Three days after treatment, a significant dose-dependent increase in Hsp27-immunoreactive protoplasmic astrocytes was found in the cingulate, frontal, occipital, and pyriform cortex, and in the hippocampus CA1
The largest portion of the posterior cingulate gyrus is located dorsal to the corpus callosum
We have now identified a novel third population of olfactory marker protein-expressing sensory neurons that is located in a discrete pocket of the rostral nasal septum, which we refer to as the septal organ of Grüneberg (SOG)
Despite their unusual location, axons projecting from the septal organ of Grüneberg(SOG) neurons fasciculate into several discrete bundles and terminate in a subset of main olfactory bulb glomeruli
The connections of the cerebellar cortex with vestibular premotor neurons of the oculomotor and collimotor systems in the pigeon were delineated in experiments using WGA-HRP as an anterograde and retrograde tracer
The retrograde data indicate that ipsilateral projections upon oculomotor neurons arise from the medial portions of the superior (VeS) and tangential (Ta) nuclei
Projections upon neck premotor neurons arise primarily from neurons in the interstitial region of the vestibular nuclear complex
With the exception of VDL, vestibular nuclei projecting to neck motoneurons also project to extraocular motoneurons
Exposure to 3H-TdR given at E36 labels a few neurons in the deepest layers of the entorhinal area, and 3H-TdR given at E38 labels a small number of neurons in all hippocampal subdivisions
Postmitotic neurons migrate from a zone(s) near the ventricles to the neocortex
The number of glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) -positive cells in the cortical plate increased steadily with time so that, by P26, glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) -immunoreactive astrocytes were distributed evenly through all cortical laminae
The distribution of the retinal efferents to the optic tectum is unique in the flatfish
In the middle part of the tectum, two bands of degeneration remained over the stratum griseum et fibrosum superficiale(sgfs) 
Distinct layer was lacking in the medial tectum with a conspicuously absent large cell layer in the stratum griseum centrale (sgc)
Using measurements of cortical thickness and surface area, the total number of cells in the striate cortex of one hemisphere was derived for each glial cell type
These changes, however, were only a response to a substantial overshoot in cortical volume at six months: the total number of astrocytes in the striate cortex did not change
Olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) axonal extension and targeting occur within the olfactory nerve layer (ONL) of the olfactory bulb (OB)
The data demonstrate that, as Olfactory sensory neuron(OSN) axons begin to exit the olfactory nerve layer(ONL) o and target a specific region of the olfactory bulb(OB) , there is a down-regulation of cytoskeletal elements and bound extracellular adhesion molecules
These islands of Calleja complex(ICC) units change progressively in cytoarchitecture from the lateral to the medial edge of the olfactory tubercle
The first two unit types display prominently two additional components of the feline islands of Calleja complex(ICC) -namely, clusters of dwarf cells and small pyramidal-like neurons constituting the densocellular layer cupping the base of lateral Callejal islands
In the accumbal islands of Calleja complex(ICC) , satellite neurons are most conspicuous in granule-cell-poor spaces within the isla magna, where many non-granular neurons are uncharacteristically small and chromophobic
The isla magna itself is unusual not only for its large size but for lateral extensions encircling a group of accumbal neurons far caudally
Such extensions are one of several indications that the isla magna is intimately associated with the nucleus accumbens
Hair cell regeneration is well documented in the inner ear sensory epithelia of lower vertebrates and birds and may occur in the vestibular organs of mammals
The subdivisions of the sciatic nerve, the sural, lateral sural, superficial peroneal, and tibial nerves each projected to a separate and distinct region of the superficial dorsal horn and collectively formed a "U"-shaped zone of terminal labeling extending from lumbar spinal segments L2 to the caudal portions of L5
In the larval and adult retina, both melanopsins are expressed in a subset of cells in the inner retina, resembling amacrine and ganglion cells
The Golgi impregnated neurons in inferior and lateral pulvinar are typical of other thalamic nuclei and are not qualitatively different in the two subdivisions
The distributions of orphanin FQ (OFQ/N; also known as nociceptin) and its cognate receptor, opioid receptor-like receptor-1 (NOP), overlap steroid-responsive regions throughout reproductive circuits of the limbic system and hypothalamus
We studied estrogen and progesterone regulation of OFQ/N and NOP mRNA expression in limbic-hypothalamic reproductive circuits
In the caudal part of the posterodorsal medial amygdala, estrogen increased OFQ/N mRNA levels, and progesterone did not alter this increase, whereas, in the medial part of the medial preoptic nucleus, estrogen and progesterone were needed to increase OFQ/N mRNA levels
Steroid regulation of OFQ/N and NOP in the medial preoptic nucleus and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus(VMH) is consistent with emerging data indicating that this opioid system regulates female reproduction
In the lumbosacral cord all parts of the spinal gray matter were found to contain catecholamines
In the intermediate gray the intermediolateral nucleus in thoracic and upper lumbar segments was the most heavily innervated area, followed by the medial lumbar sympathetic group, which contains the majority of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons innervating the pelvic organs
Following a crush lesion of the facial nerve, there was no cell loss in facial nuclei of normal (C57BL/6J) adult mice, but 40% cell loss occurred in Ola mice and the survivors increased in size during the period when functional reinnervation was established
Moreover, retina input specifies the topography of callosal projections by postnatal day (P)6
After restricted intracortical injections of anterogradely and retrogradely transported tracers we observed that the normal, nonmirror-symmetric callosal map, as well as the anomalous, mirror-symmetric map observed in neonatally enucleated animals, are present by P6-7, just as collateral branches of simple architecture emerge from their parental axons and grow into superficial cortical layers
Our results therefore do not support the idea that retinal input guides callosal map formation by primarily promoting the large-scale elimination of long, nontopographic branches and arbors
Instead, they suggest that retinal input specifies the sites on the parental axons from which interstitial branches will grow to invade middle and upper cortical layers, thereby ensuring that the location of invading interstitial branches is accurately related to the topographical location of the soma that gives rise to the parental axon
The postnatal development of a population of superior colliculus projecting retinal ganglion cells with large somata in hamsters aged from postnatal day (P) 4 to adult was studied by the intracellular injection of Lucifer Yellow
Following optic nerve transection and horseradish peroxidase(HRP) impregnation, contralateral retinal afferents show a restricted, dense core of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) label in the superficial portion of the nucleus with sparser horseradish peroxidase(HRP) label in the surround
Ipsilateral retinal afferents arborize throughout nucleus lentiformis mesencephali(nLM) , except in the dense-core region
Afferents from the tectum and anterior thalamus appear to arborize throughout the nucleus without discernible pattern
In the rostral part of the subnucleus caudalis (Vc) they were confined to lamina V (caudalis type collaterals) and in the caudal part of Vc and in cervical segments they were confined to lamina III/IV (spinal-dorsal-horn-type collaterals)
The differential laminar distribution of collateral arbors of single axons along the rostrocaudal axis distinguishes the spinal trigeminal nucleus from the spinal dorsal horn where functional types of mechanoreceptive afferents form continuous or interrupted sagittal columns of terminal arbors that do not shift dorsoventrally within segments
Axonal tracing techniques were used to study the projection from the cochlear nucleus to the superior paraolivary nucleus in guinea pigs
Injections of Fluoro-Gold or peroxidase-labeled-WGA and HRP into the superior paraolivary nucleus labeled multipolar cells and octopus cells bilaterally in the ventral cochlear nucleus, mainly on the contralateral side
Injections of PHAL into the ventral cochlear nucleus labeled two types of axons in the superior paraolivary nucleus
Combined anterograde and retrograde transport of different fluorescent tracers was used to identify the projections of the cells in the superior paraolivary nucleus that receive inputs from the ventral cochlear nucleus
The anterior neural tube was divided into several neuromeres: the mid-hindbrain sulcus became apparent first, then the portion rostral to this sulcus was subdivided into two portions by the syn-parencephalic boundary
In the lateral septum (LS) containing the degenerating terminals of hippocamposeptal fibers transected by fimbria-fornix transection(ff-t) , a heavy reaction of lectin-labeled activated microglial cells associated with high phagocytotic activity was noticed
Unexpectedly, after a long survival time (6 months) following fimbria-fornix transection(ff-t) , we observed an increase in microglial GSA I-B4 labeling in the medial septum(MS) 
, a strong initial reaction in the medial septum(MS) and very little microglial activation in the lateral septum(LS) , was observed after immunolesioning
Our results indicate that the microglial reaction in the medial septum(MS) following fimbria-fornix transection(ff-t) differs substantially from that seen in other models of axotomy
Ultrastructural studies of hair cells and nerve terminals in the auditory receptor organ, the basilar papilla, were carried out with transmission and scanning electron microscopes
The projections of dorsolateral visual area(DL) were determined by the intra-axonal transport of 3H-proline, 3H-acetyl-wheat germ agglutinin, and horseradish peroxidase after cortical injections
Single injections in dorsolateral visual area(DL) sometimes produced label in two separate regions in the caudal inferior temporal cortex, suggesting that functional subdivisions exist in this projection zone
A major feedback projection of dorsolateral visual area(DL) was to V-II
One branch crossed the midline to project to the spinal cord, and the other, thinner branch descended caudally in the ipsilateral medullary reticular formation without distributing any terminals
The axon of the second type projected to the contralateral spinal cord and distributed collateral branches with terminal boutons in the ipsilateral ventral respiratory group (VRG)
The third type projected to the contralateral spinal cord and distributed terminal boutons in the medial part of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and its vicinity
The fourth type distributed numerous branches with terminal boutons in and around the ventral part of the nucleus of the solitary tract(NTS) and the ventral respiratory group(VRG) area
Only a small proportion of tyrosine hydroxylase-like immunoreactive neurons in the periaqueductal gray, rostral linear nucleus, and rostrodorsal ventral tegmental area contained NADPH diaphorase activity
The other cell type was a bistratified cell with processes in both stratum 1 (s1) and stratum 4 (s4)
Computer-assisted analysis confirmed the location of substance P-containing processes at 5-15% ( stratum 1(s1) ) and 50-70% ( stratum 4(s4) ) depth levels in the inner plexiform layer
Whereas immunoreactivity was conspicuous in the ganglia of nervus terminalis (NT; or nucleus olfactoretinalis), a weak reaction was detected in some granule cells in the olfactory bulb and in the cells of area ventralis telencephali pars lateralis (Vl)
In normal frontal sections of the medulla oblongata, five columns of fibers surrounded by neuronal cell bodies could be clearly distinguished, but the number is probably fortuitous, for there was no one-on-one relationship with the five trigeminal ganglia
In addition, a dense bundle of long varicose processes projecting rostrocaudally was observed coursing along the ventral surface of the brain from the midtelencephalon to the medulla oblongata
Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of frog brain, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord extracts revealed that, in all three regions, Urotensin II(UII) -immunoreactive material eluted as a single peak which exhibited the same retention time as synthetic frog Urotensin II(UII) 
Intense or moderate expression of mGluR4 mRNA was detected in the granule cells of the olfactory bulb and cerebellum, whereas no significant expression of mGluR7 mRNA was found in these cells
We examined this idea further by comparing the pattern of cytochrome oxidase(CO) stripes with the distribution of neurons in V2 that project to the superior colliculus
Visually evoked activity in the superior colliculus is known to be greatly reduced by blocking magnocellular but not parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)
The spinothalamic input was directed mostly to the ventral posterior complex and cells just caudal to it
To verify this apparent dependence of parvalbumin(Parv) expression on Purkinje cell(PC) input in the deep cerebellar nuclei(DCN) , the patterns of expression in five other cerebellar mutants (weaver, staggerer, leaner, nervous, and lurcher) with differing grades and chronologies of Purkinje cell(PC) loss were compared
In staggerer mice, neurons immunopositive for parvalbumin(Parv) as well as for Calbindin D-28k(Calb) were present in outer deep cerebellar nuclei(DCN) areas, likely representing ectopic Purkinje cell(PC) s rather than deep cerebellar nuclei(DCN) neurons
The axons of two groups of Manduca sexta allatostatin(Mas-AS) -immunoreactive neurosecretory cells in the pars lateralis form part of the nervi corporis cardiaci (NCC 1)
Ipsilateral spinal motor neurons also appeared clustered within the spinal cord and had thicker dendrites
Double labeling experiments indicated light and electron microscopically colocalization of mGluR7a- and mGluR8-LI in axon terminals on dendritic shafts of presumed interneurons in the superficial layer of the olfactory tubercle and layer Ia of the piriform cortex
The results suggest that glutamate release from axon terminals of projection fibers from MOB and AOB is regulated presynaptically and differentially through mGluR2/3, mGluR7a, and/or mGluR8
The dorsomedial(DM) nucleus also had numerous dendritic bundles extending across the midline, linking the dorsomedial(DM) nuclei bilaterally
In additional experiments, the afferent projections to the medial and anterolateral divisions were examined, providing an anatomical description of the tonotopicity of the lower auditory nuclei
Deposits of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) in the DPD labeled cells in each of the lower brainstem auditory nuclei that have previously been shown to project to the entire central nucleus of the inferior colliculus
When deposits of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) were made into other frequency band representations of the inferior colliculus, in either the medial or anterolateral division, labeled cells again formed slabs in each lower nucleus
In this study, we explore the contralateral connections that the zona incerta(ZI) has with its opposing nucleus as well as with the other nuclei of the thalamus
Injections of biotinylated dextran or cholera toxin subunit B were made into each of the different zona incerta(ZI) sectors (rostral, dorsal, ventral, and caudal) and into intralaminar and higher order dorsal thalamic nuclei of Sprague-Dawley rats by using stereotaxic coordinates
These patterns of labelling were confirmed after tracer injections into intralaminar and higher order nuclei; after such injections, labelling was seen in the contralateral zona incerta(ZI) 
The typical network formed by retinal fibers in the five retinorecipient layers of tectum is illustrated in camera lucida drawings
The youngest terminal arbors from peripheral retina were next to the path of their fascicle along the tectal periphery, connected to their fascicle by short, centrally directed extrafascicular axons
Terminal arbors from intermediate retina occupied intermediate positions in the tectum
The projection of the entorhinal cortex (EA) to the hippocampus in the cat has been studied by electrophysiological methods
Unit activity elicited by hippocampal stimulation was measured in the entorhinal cortex(EA) 
Assuming that the sites of maximal AEP amplitude correspond to the location of the major synaptic inputs, it can be concluded that the active synaptic inputs arising along a latero-medial axis in the entorhinal cortex(EA) are distributed within the hippocampus according to a septotemporal axis, although with some overlap between the different projections
Therefore it may be concluded that the hippocampus is not homogeneous with respect to the inputs from the entorhinal cortex(EA) 
Purkinje cells in the eminentia granularis posterior (EGp) and medialis (EGm) and the medial valvula cerebelli (VCbm) are zebrin II-
Zebrin II antigenicity is first present at 6 days postspawning (P6) in the eminentia granularis anterior(EGa) and at P8 in the corpus cerebelli(CCb) 
Additionally, Eigenmannia has a third class of Purkinje cells, in the eminentia granularis posterior(EGp) and EGm, that never express zebrin II immunoreactivity, indicating that zebrin II expression is not an obligatory feature of Purkinje cell development in all vertebrates
The distribution of noradrenaline (NA) immunoreactivity in the forebrain and midbrain of the lizard Gekko gecko was studied by means of recently developed antibodies against noradrenaline(NA) 
Noradrenaline-containing cell bodies are found in the hypothalamic periventricular organ and ependymal wall of the infundibular recess of the diencephalon
Noradrenaline-immunoreactive ( noradrenaline(NA) i) fibers and varicosities are widely, but not uniformly, distributed throughout the forebrain and midbrain
Moderately dense plexuses of noradrenaline(NA) i fibers are found in the small-celled medial cortex, the dorsal cortex, and the midbrain tectum
The remaining forebrain and midbrain areas are generally not or only sparsely innervated by noradrenaline(NA) i fibers
A remarkable exception is that the cells in the hypothalamic periventricular organ and ependymal wall of the infundibular recess are immunonegative for dopamine-beta-hydroxylase(DBH) 
Degenerating pallidothalamic projections emerging from the anterior part of the pallidum formed two diffuse groups of fibers; one coursed ventromedially directly through the internal capsule without forming a lenticular fasciculus and terminated uniformly in the reticular, VA, VD, VM and the medial part of the VE
The otehr group coursed ventrolaterally in the internal capsule and, without forming an ansa lenticularis, entered the zona incerta, swept medially through and ventral to the medial lemniscus, and terminated in the medial part of the VE and throughout the VD
A similar pattern of Ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) R alpha-ir was seen within all cranial motor nuclei with general somatic efferent function (III, IV, motor V, VI, VII, and XII cranial nerves)
A few Ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) R alpha-ir neurons were seen within the globus pallidus with concomitant terminal-like staining within the subthalamic nucleus
Autonomic regions such as the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve and the interomedial lateral cell column of the thoracic spinal cord also contained Ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) R alpha-ir neurons
Finally, the hippocampus displayed dense Ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) R alpha-ir within the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampal formation and the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus
Afferent fibers of the IX terminate in the glossopharyngeal lobe (L-IX)
Most afferent fibers of the X terminate in the sensory layer of the vagal lobe (L-X), in which degenerating terminals occur in some laminae
Ascending secondary fibers from the L-VII project bilaterally to the secondary gustatory nucleus (nGS) in the isthmus region
Descending secondary fibers from the L-VII turn caudally in the SpV
These fibers terminate mostly in the nucleus of the SpV  and sparsely in the nFM
The L-IX and L-X give rise to the long and short secondary paths
The short path includes secondary fibers projecting to the motor layer of the L-X and the medullary reticular formation
The spatiotemporal distribution of cell death in the chick embryo neural tube and spinal cord (brachial region) was examined between stage (St
One region, the dorsal pycnotic zone, was located in the most dorsal part of the spinal cord, including the neural crest, with the highest number of pycnotic cells observed at stage(St
The afferent and efferent projections of a vocal control nucleus, the oval nucleus of the hyperstriatum ventrale (HVo), were mapped out in a parrot, the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus) to determine the relationships of this nucleus to the auditory system
HVo has also been shown to receive input from neurons in the immediately adjacent HV (Durand et al
Thus, the focus of the present study was to elucidate relationships between HVo, its immediately adjacent surround and telencephalic auditory nuclei
Neurons in the HV immediately medial to HVo project to a shell region around the entire nucleus
Interestingly, elevated levels of GIRK2 protein in the Ts65Dn hippocampus and frontal cortex correlated with elevated levels of GIRK1 protein
This suggests that heteromeric GIRK1-GIRK2 channels are overexpressed in Ts65Dn hippocampus and frontal cortex, which could impair excitatory input and modulate spike frequency and synaptic kinetics in the affected regions
However, in the Ts65Dn mouse a strong immunofluorescent staining of GIRK2 was detected in the lacunosum molecular layer of the CA3 area of the hippocampus
In addition, tyrosine hydroxylase containing dopaminergic neurons that coexpress GIRK2 were more numerous in the substantia nigra compacta and ventral tegmental area in the Ts65Dn compared to diploid controls
Double-label retrograde transport techniques were used to label cells projecting to area 17 with one fluorescent dye and to label cells projecting to posteromedial lateral suprasylvian(PMLS) cortex with a different dye
Following injections into the two cortical areas, some cells were double labeled and some were single labeled in all three thalamic nuclei studied
However, the relative number of double- and single-labeled cells, as well as the relative number of cells single-labeled following injections into each cortical area, differed among the three thalamic nuclei
In both medial interlaminar nucleus(MIN) and the C-laminae of the LGNd, the number of double-labeled cells was small
In contrast, a relatively large number of cells were single labeled with the dye placed in area 17, especially in the C-laminae of the LGNd
In lateral posterior nucleus(LPl) , many cells were labeled after the cortical injections
This indicates that almost all lateral posterior nucleus(LPl) cells that project to one cortical area also project to the other via a bifurcating axon
Cochlear terminals of the three spontaneous rate(SR) groups differ in caliber and synaptic position around the inner hair cell (Liberman [1982b] Science 216:1239-1241); central terminals differ in degree of branching and in which subregions of the cochlear nucleus (CN) are targeted (Liberman [1991] J
In areas 32 and 25, three defined bands of diffuse nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate(NADPH) diaphorase staining were located in layer 2 and in upper and deep layer 5
From cortical thickness data and neuronal N(V) estimates, the absolute number of neurones under 1 mm2 of cortical surface (N(C)) have been derived
The reorganizations of the overall intrinsic glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic hippocampal networks as well as the time course of these reorganizations during development of pilocarpine-induced temporal lobe epilepsy were studied with in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry experiments for the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) and the vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) transporter (VGAT)
This is illustrated by a recovery of vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGLUT1) immunoreactivity in the inner molecular layer and an increased vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGLUT1) immunolabeling in the CA1-CA3 dendritic layers
The afferent connections to the Wulst, a well-defined bulge in the forebrain roof, were studied in the pigeon
The results demonstrate a bilateral intratelencephalic pathway arising from the archistriatum intermedium (Ai) in the basal forebrain
dorsolateralis posterior</BrainRegion> (DLP) on both sides of the brain, provide anatomical evidence for a bilateral forebrain projection of the somatosensory thalamus
annularis</BrainRegion> (Anl), locus coeruleus (LoC), and the avian homologue of the raphe nucleus, <BrainRegion>n
Most of the axons in the medial and vertical lobes of adult cockroach mushroom bodies derive from class I Kenyon cells and are organized into regular, alternating pairs (doublets) of pale and dark laminae
The pattern of projections of peripheral receptors to the neocortex in the second somesthetic receiving area (SII) was mapped in raccoons
The purpose was to determine if the projection area of peripheral receptors to the forepaw area in the somesthetic receiving area(SII) region is disproportionally enlarged as it is in SI
The forepaw area in somesthetic receiving area(SII) shows an enlargement commensurate with that found in the SI
This suggests that those factors that are selective for tactile acuity of the raccoon forepaw were operating in the evolution of somesthetic receiving area(SII) as they were in SI
The somatotopic organization of mechanoreceptive projections to somesthetic receiving area(SII) is reversed mediolaterally compared to previous descriptions of this arrangement in other mammals: projections form axial structures lie medially and those from apical structures lie laterally along the inferior bank of the suprasylvian sulcus in the raccoon
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP), fluorescein-, or Texas red-(TRDA) coupled dextran-amine applied into the oculomotor nucleus of larval lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) retrogradely labeled two populations of contralateral abducens interneurons, one lateral and the other periventricular
Tracer application to the abducens nucleus anterogradely labeled thick contralateral fibers that specifically contact the medial rectus motor subnucleus by means of large boutons
This lateral rectus (abducens) -- medial rectus (oculomotor) internuclear projection of lampreys appears to be similar to those involved in the coordination of horizontal eye movements in mammals
The periventricular abducens interneurons projected bilaterally to other oculomotor subnuclei
Tracer application to the abducens nucleus labeled a group of small interneurons in the ipsilateral dorsal rectus motor subnucleus
These data indicate that, in these deprived cats, there is little or no cortical development for visual orienting, but cortex is necessary for visual discrimination learning
The distribution of these immunoreactive fibers in the fimbria and lateral septal nucleus is most consistent with an anteriorly directed efferent hippocampal pathway
Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) in a slow-release polyacrylamide gel pellet was implanted in the medulla or spinal cord of the rat
Large numbers of retrogradely labeled cells were visualized by immunocytochemical procedures in specific nuclei of the forebrain mainly ipsilateral to the implant site following implants as far caudal as the sacral segments of the spinal cord
Total average number of labeled forebrain cells (three brains per category; 100 micron per 150 micron of brain tissue were examined microscopically): medulla, 2,115; cervical, 1,878; lumbar, 1,017; sacral, 385
Labeled cells were also seen in the medial basal hypothalamus and the rostral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis
Therefore, we interpret the paucity or absence of labeled cells in particular brain regions to indicate that cells of these regions do not project to the medulla or spinal cord
These results suggest that the roles of L1 and TAG-1 in the formation of the commissures in the forebrain are different from their roles in the spinal cord
Anterogradely labeled fibers in the mamillotegmental tract diverged from the principal mamillary tract in an extensive dorsocaudally oriented swath of axons which extended to the dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei, and numerous axons turned sharply ventrally and rostrally to terminate topographically in the dorsomedial nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis and rostromedial pontine nuclei
These findings indicate that neurons in the dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei are reciprocally connected with mamillary body(MB) projection neurons
We compared the expression patterns of these pallial marker genes with that of the subpallial gene xDistal-less-4 (xDll4)
Our results indicate that the whole pallium of Xenopus expresses the T-box genes XenopusTbr1(xTbr1) and xEomes (in proliferating cells and/or mantle) during embryonic and larval development, and the expression of these genes is topographically complementary to that of xDistal-less-4(xDll4) in the subpallium
On the other hand, during development xEmx1 is expressed in a large part of the pallium (proliferating and postmitotic cells) except for an area adjacent to the pallio-subpallial boundary, where xEmx1 is observed only in some mantle cells
In contrast, the caudal part of the previously termed lateral amygdalar nucleus shows strong xEmx1 expression and may be a lateral pallial derivative
Finally, expression of XenopusTbr1(xTbr1) , xEomes, and xEmx1 is observed in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb from early developmental stages, further supporting that this structure is a pallial derivative
A total of 2,736 wheat germ-agglutinated horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) -stained neurons were located within the ipsilateral superior colliculus (SC), and a few labeled cells were consistently found bilaterally in the external nuclei of the inferior colliculus
Nor was the suprageniculate nucleus(Sg) injection site location related to the laminar distribution of superior colliculus(SC) projection neurons
Immunoreactive cells with dendrite- and axonlike processes were observed also in the parapineal organ and the habenular nucleus
326:375-401, '92), while the other cortical areas mentioned also have direct projections to the structures of the inner cortical vestibular circuit
One hundred nine dendrites from six ventral posterolateral (VPL) neurons and six ventral posteromedial (VPM) neurons were examined
The mean path distance (length from soma to a dendritic tip) was very similar for all dendrites in each group ( ventral posterolateral(VPL) or ventral posteromedial(VPM) ) regardless of the number of branches found along the path distance
In the visual system of the cat the projection from the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus has been studied extensively
Retinogeniculate axons and lateral geniculate neurons are labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) via injections into the optic tracts and optic radiations, respectively
They are examined with the light microscope to identify labeled lateral geniculate neurons that appear to be contacted by labeled retinal axons
This light microscopic analysis indicates that individual class 1 cells are contacted by many retinogeniculate axons (&amp;gt; 10) and that each of these axons contacts many lateral geniculate neurons (&amp;gt; 20)
Thus, intrinsic choroidal neurons may represent peripherally displaced pterygopalatine ganglion neurons forming a local network for regulation of vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle tone in the duck choroid
The morphologic and synaptic features of neurons in the rat caudal nucleus tractus solitarius(NTS) were assessed using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and biocytin labeling in brainstem slices
The osseous capsula of the ear has two foramina other than the nerve foramina
Eighth nerve projections to the valvula cerebelli are less prominent than the projections from the lateral line
Eighth nerve and lateral line nerve efferents arise from a common nucleus, the octavolateralis efferent nucleus
Axons of efferent cells may divide to supply two or more branches of the eighth nerve and some axons supply both lateral line and eighth nerve endorgans
To further address the hypothesis that cholecystokinin (CCK) in the medullary dorsal horn (MDH) arises from intrinsic or higher-order neurons, cholecystokinin(CCK) -8-specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) and immunohistochemical (IHC) experiments were carried out in adult rats after trigeminal tractotomy
radioimmunoassay(RIA) and immunohistochemical(IHC) methods were also used to assess medullary dorsal horn(MDH) cholecystokinin(CCK) concentrations in adult rats subjected to left infraorbital nerve section at birth
The left medulla contained significantly higher levels of cholecystokinin(CCK) than the control right medulla (1
To determine if the neonatal lesion-induced increase in medullary cholecystokinin(CCK) is due to primary afferent or higher-order reorganization, radioimmunoassay(RIA) and immunohistochemical(IHC) experiments were run after infraorbital nerve section at birth and trigeminal tractotomy in adulthood
In C6 it forms a dorsoventrally oriented narrow region at the lateral border of the ventral horn; in C7 and rostral C8 it forms a broad column in the dorsolateral corner of the ventral horn
Their axons invade the telencephalon on fetal day 16 and run in the intermediate zone just below the cortical plate, reaching the visual area of fetal day 18
In the transverse axis, neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive cells seemed to follow a faint suprapyramidal to infrapyramidal gradient, which was due to differential timing of neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive cells destined for the stratum infragranulosum of the suprapyramidal and infrapyramidal blades of the fascia dentata
Northern analysis of reelin mRNA from normal rats showed that rat reelin was expressed as a approximately 12-kb transcript in both the cerebrum and the cerebellum, whereas reelin expression was markedly reduced in the shaking rat Kawasaki(SRK) brains
In situ hybridization analysis showed that reelin mRNA in the shaking rat Kawasaki(SRK) brains was expressed in Cajal-Retzius cells in the marginal zone of the cerebral cortex and outer granular cells in the cerebellar cortex in similar manners to normal controls, but its expression was considerably reduced
On Western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses using antibodies specific for the Reelin protein, no immunoproduct was recognized in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices
Two groups of adrenergic cells, which are equivalent to those of other species, were detected: Group C1 in the ventrolateral medulla and group C2 in the dorsomedial medulla
In group C2, some immunoreactive cell bodies smaller than those in C1 and many nerve terminals are found in the motor nucleus of the vagus, but most of the adrenergic cells and fibers are observed in the nucleus tractus solitarii
Our data give new information about the adrenergic system in the medulla oblongata, especially in the nucleus tractus solitarii of the tree shrew, a species that provides a useful model of a small primate brain
The superior olivary complex is a major source of auditory projections to the inferior colliculus
Although the projections from the medial and lateral superior olivary nuclei have been well characterized, projections from the surrounding periolivary nuclei have received relatively little attention
The lateral, dorsal, and medial periolivary groups project bilaterally, and the ventral periolivary group projects ipsilaterally
The remaining periolivary nuclei project only ipsilaterally or contain separate populations of cells that project to the two inferior colliculi
The distribution and morphology of Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive (NPY-ir) neurons in the olfactory bulb and the olfactory peduncle was studied in the adult cat and rat, and the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus
In all three species, the population of Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive(NPY-ir) neurons is localized in the white matter extending from the main olfactory bulb to the border of the striatum
The former, ipsilateral projection terminates in the granule cell layer of the main and accessory olfactory bulb and in layer II/III of the anterior olfactory nucleus
Reconstruction of the latter projection has revealed that the fibers are continuous with the olfactory limb of the anterior commissure and the anterior commissure proper suggesting a commissural contralateral projection
Later in development the fiber density in the olfactory limb and the anterior commissure becomes considerably reduced
In contrast, the plexus density in the anterior olfactory nucleus and the granule cell layer of the main and accessory olfactory bulb undergoes only a slight reduction, and the Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive(NPY-ir) cell number remains roughly constant
We found that novel projections from the intact ventral cochlear nucleus(VCN) to ipsilateral medial nucleus of the trapezoid body(MNTB) emerge after lesions performed as late as postnatal day 25
Foliation patterns correlate with the expansion of the cerebellar layers and of total cerebellar area
Furthermore, the temporal-to-septal axis of origin in the septal two-thirds of the subiculum corresponded to a ventrolateral-to-dorsomedial axis of termination in the medial mammillary nucleus
These results suggest that different populations of neurons existing along the longitudinal axis of the subiculum may exert their influences on the execution of different hypothalamic functions
The habenular nuclei also appear to project to the central nucleus of the amygdala
Neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and superior colliculus (SC) were generated at P1-P10 and P1-P18 respectively
Peak numbers of labelled cells were seen at P3 and P5 in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus(dLGN) and superior colliculus(SC) 
Cell death was assessed in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus(dLGN) and superior colliculus(SC) of young aged P10-P150
With further development, the retinal basal lamina was not reestablished; newly developing neuroepithelium in the peripheral retina, however, generated an intact basal lamina
The present data demonstrate that the retinal basal lamina, by anchoring the neuroepithelial cells to the pial surface of the retina, has an important function in the development of the normal cytoarchitecture of this structure
We have investigated the target dependence of hypoglossal motor neurons in postnatal rats by transecting the hypoglossal nerve and preventing reinnervation of the tongue
Moreover, many of the dendrites in this nucleus of the solitary tract(NTS) region express both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and serotonin (5HT) 2A receptors, and some of these dendrites may arise from the adjacent dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus(DMNV) 
The neurogenetic gradients of neurons showing glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) immunoreactivity were determined in the regio superior and in the regio inferior of the mouse hippocampus
Radial gradients of neurogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive cells are characterized by two main features: 1) with the exception of the stratum lacunosum-moleculare and its interface with the stratum radiatum, glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive neurons of the plexiform strata are generated before those destined for the pyramidal layer; 2) within the pyramidal layer, glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -positive cells are positioned according to an inside-out sequence
Given the selective laminar disposition of the GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampus, the present authors explored whether or not the diverse types of these interneurons could have specific birth dates and concluded that no relationship exists between birth dates and adult phenotypes of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) -immunoreactive cells in the mouse hippocampus proper
We examined in rats the relationship between the ordering of retinal axons in the optic pathway and the formation of a retinotopically organized projection to their primary target, the contralateral superior colliculus (SC)
We have previously found that axons labeled by focal injections of 1,1'-dioctadecyl 3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) made in temporal or nasal retina of perinatal rats commonly mistarget along the medial-lateral and rostral-caudal axes of the superior colliculus(SC) 
In the present study, we made similar 1,1'-dioctadecyl 3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate(DiI) injections, covering less than 2% of the retinal area, in peripheral temporal, nasal, superior, or inferior retina, in rats of two age groups, embryonic day (E) 21 to P (postnatal day) 2 and P11-P17
In retina, labeled axons travel in fascicles directly from the injection site to the optic disc, but neighbor relationships begin to degrade as fascicles split and mix
Retinotopic order is virtually lost in the optic nerve; axons labeled from each injection site disperse throughout its cross-sectional area, but the labeled axons tend to be concentrated toward a specific half of the nerve depending upon their retinal origin
However, the distributions of labeled retinal axons observed in whole mounts of the retina and optic pathway have a degree of disorder similar to those in E21-P2 rats
The localization of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor subunits to neurons throughout the macaque hypothalamus provides further evidence for the glutamatergic regulation of neuroendocrine, autonomic, and limbic circuits
Other fibers ran through the dorsal two-thirds of the external pallidum en route to the putamen
We used steroid autoradiography to measure the ontogeny of steroid accumulation in the spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus(SNB) and the retrodorsolateral nucleus (RDLN), two motoneuronal groups thought to differ in their sensitivity to androgens
spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus(SNB) and retrodorsolateral nucleus(RDLN) motoneurons differ in the ontogeny of androgen accumulation
The lateral part of the medial accessory olive projects to more lateral parts of these lobules with the exception of lobule VII
The rostral half of the medial accessory olive projects to lobule IX and to the hemisphere
The other projections of the accessory olives and the principal olive to the hemisphere are similar to those reported for the cat
An accessory cell group in the sheep, located between the principal and the dorsal accessory olive, has connections with the caudal vermis and the hemisphere
The goal of this study was to determine the compartmental organization of 5'-nucleotidase within the rodent ventral striatum and to compare the distribution of 5'-nucleotidase with that of leu-enkephalin, cell clusters, and infralimbic cortical innervation
This "medial band" extends from the rostral pole of the ventral striatum to the bed nucleus of stria terminalis
The innervation of the ventral striatum by the infralimbic cortex is denser in the shell than in the core
Overall, the compartmental structure of 5'-nucleotidase in the ventral striatum segregates projections from different layers of the infralimbic cortex
Application of wheat germ agglutinin horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) to the superior sagittal sinus and adjacent areas of the supratentorial dura mater labeled numerous neurons in each of the left and right superior cervical ganglia
Also, the lateral septum(LS) was divided into dorsal, intermediate, and ventral parts ( lateral septum(LS) d, lateral septum(LS) i, and lateral septum(LS) v), and the volume and number of single-stranded DNA(ssDNA) -immunoreactive cells in each part were measured on PD6, 8, 11, 16, and 31
There was no sex difference in volume or number of apoptotic cells in the lateral septum(LS) d or lateral septum(LS) v
If all L and LD cells are formed at the retinal margin and first develop oriented dendrites, we have to assume that the more randomly oriented dendritic trees in the central retina have undergone a reorganization
To find out whether a zonal pattern exists in the cerebellar cortex, a topological analysis was made of the Purkinje cell layer of a Nissl-stained series of the cerebellum
In the experimental part of this study, the corticonuclear projections to the cerebellar nuclei and the vestibular nuclear complex were demonstrated with the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) technique
Two strips of Purkinje cells remained unlabeled: One in the rostrolateral part of the intermediate zone, and another in the medial part of the medial zone
After horseradish peroxidase(HRP) gel implantations in the cerebellar peduncle aimed at the medial and lateral cerebellar nuclei, respectively
It can be concluded that cerebellar zones as demonstrated in the turtle Pseudemys scripta elegans, are phylogenetically very old and may represent the basic functional circuit of the cerebellum
In neonatal rats the unilateral transection of the cerebellar peduncles causes a fast and complete degeneration of the contralateral inferior olive
Although its specificity was not totally maintained, the mediolateral distribution of sprouted afferents in the cerebellum matched the caudorostral disposition of parent neurons in the olive, as in the case in normal olivocerebellar projection
Anterograde studies showed that compensatory fibers recrossing the cerebellar midline spread throughout the whole extent of the deprived cortex and terminate solely in the molecular layer as typical climbing fibers
Peptide-like immunoreactivity was observed in axons within the optic nerve stump retinal to the crush, as in previous studies (Kuljis and Karten, '83b, Kuljis et al
The optic nerve contralateral to the procedure displayed only occasional isolated peptide-containing fibers, as in normal optic nerves
The retinae ipsilateral and contralateral to the crush exhibited no change in the normal pattern of peptide-like immunoreactivity, including the absence of demonstrable peptide-like immunoreactivity in the somata of retinal ganglion cells
The patterns of leucine enkephalin(LENK) -, CCK8-, and bombesin(BOM) -like immunoreactivities in the tectum were identical to those following irreversible retinal deafferentation as long as 9 months postoperatively
The antennal lobes (ALs) are the primary olfactory centers in the insect brain
To assign the input-output connectivity of all glomeruli, we investigated the spatial relationship of the antennal tracts and two prominent AL output tracts (medial and lateral ACT) mainly formed by uniglomerular (u) projection neurons(PNs) using fluorescent tracing, confocal microscopy, and 3D analyses
The results revealed a clear segregation of glomeruli into two AL hemispheres specifically supplied by projection neurons(PNs) of the medial and lateral ACT
Tracing of three mediolateral (ml) antenno-cerebral tracts(ACTs) mainly formed by multiglomerular projection neurons(PNs) revealed terminals in distinct compartments of the lateral horn(LH) and in three olfactory foci within the lateral protocerebrum
Columns of 30-50 microns in diameter are hypothesized to be a general feature of cortical organization, but no quantitative analysis of different human cortical areas has been performed
These zones vary in relative thickness around the circumference of the olfactory bulb; the deep zone is proportionally thicker in the most dorsal and ventral parts of the bulb
The results show that very few, if any, thalamic neurons project to more than one area of cortex
Rather, the prefrontal cortex is defined by multiple specific relationships with the thalamus
Corticospinal axons are first present in the contralateral spinal gray of lower cervical cord at day 5 and in the contralateral spinal gray of lower lumbar and sacral cord by day 9
Therefore, we sought to test the hypothesis that the cardiovascular nucleus tractus solitarii, the site of termination of arterial baroreceptor nerves, projects to pontine preganglionic neurons whose stimulation elicits cerebral vasodilatation
The study establishes the presence of a direct monosynaptic pathway from neurons in the cardiovascular nucleus tractus solitarii to pontine preganglionic parasympathetic neurons that project to the pterygopalatine ganglia, the source of nitroxidergic vasodilatory innervation of cerebral blood vessels
4 is expressed in glial cells and not in axons in the rat spinal cord white matter and that its expression is markedly increased in cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage after chronic spinal cord injury(SCI) 
To determine whether an equivalent adrenergic population is present in the rostroventrolateralis(RVL) of the cat, we used antibodies raised against bovine adrenal phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase(PNMT) to map the distribution of adrenaline-synthesizing neurons in the reticular formation
The majority of labeled cells were seen in a nucleus designated rostroventrolateralis(RVL) at the level of the rostral one-third of the inferior olive
Our results are consistent with the notion that an area of the rostroventrolateralis(RVL) containing adrenergic perikarya is the anatomical structure responsible for cardiovascular changes that occur when chemicals are applied to Schlaefke's area
Previous work from our laboratory and others, examining synapses between neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei and neurons in the thalamus revealed ultrastructural characteristics that have been implicated in the expression of synaptic plasticity at other locations in the brain
Mutations in the survival motor neuron(SMN) gene cause spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), an autosomal recessive disease characterized by degeneration of lower motor neurons in the spinal cord leading to progressive muscle wasting
At this caudal level, it reaches its maximal elongation and extends from the ventral tip of the lateral ventricles to the dorsolateral aspects of the paraventricular nucleus
Staining also appeared at specific stages in the spinal cord, the retina, and the skin
neuropeptide Y(NPY) -neurons are generated between E14 and E20 and are found in layers II-VI of the cortex and the subcortical white matter
The projection to M1 shared relatively limited zones of origin with the projections directed to PMvc(PM) 
The A1 neurons of the caudal ventrolateral medulla were much more scattered than in rats or rabbits, but relatively similar to cats
An ascending catecholaminergic fiber pathway was traced through the central tegmental field of the canine medulla and pons, with features similar to the primate
Responses to electrical stimulation of the oculomotor complex and the vestibular nerves were characterized and selected neurons were injected with horseradish peroxidase(HRP) 
Neurons antidromically activated by oculomotor complex stimulation were generally monosynaptically excited by the ipsilateral vestibular nerve
Notable was the absence of strong commissural inhibition by stimulation of the contralateral vestibular nerve
Light microscopy of antidromically identified injected cells demonstrated that these cells are predominantly located at the central levels of the superior vestibular nucleus along the incoming vestibular nerve fibers but a few are found at more caudal levels
In the avian auditory system, the neural network for computing the localization of sound in space begins with bilateral innervation of nucleus laminaris (NL) by nucleus magnocellularis (NM) neurons
We used antibodies against the neural specific markers Hu C/D, neurofilament, and SV2 together with retrograde fluorescent dextran labeling from the contralateral hindbrain to identify nucleus magnocellularis(NM) neurons within the anlage and follow their development
By observing the pattern of neuronal rearrangements together with the pattern of contralaterally projecting nucleus magnocellularis(NM) fibers, we could identify nucleus laminaris(NL) in the ventral anlage
Thus, extensive pathfinding and morphological rearrangement of central auditory nuclei occurs well before the arrival of cochlear afferents
In the first stage, each germinal cell becoming a ganglion cell extends an axon into the fibre layer of the retina and towards the optic disc, and the soma of the cell moves towards the ganglion cell layer
The emergence of the B16 protein was also examined in retina from mice homozygous for the retinal degeneration (rd) mutation which affects photoreceptor synaptogenesis
Application of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B (ChB) in the third ventricle resulted in uptake in ependymal axons and backfilling of perikarya in the dorsomedian part of the dorsal raphe nucleus, immediately under the caudal aqueduct
) s neither in the subcommissural organ(SCO) nor in the ependyma
However, on embryonic day(ED) 17 we consistently found retrogradely labeled cells in the hippocampus, indicating that the development of the hippocamposeptal projection precedes that of the septohippocampal projection
A comparative analysis of individual growth cones found in the fimbria and the hippocampus proper revealed no striking differences in their morphology
Electron microscopic analysis showed that growth cones in the fimbria were mainly contacted by other axons, whereas growth cones in the hippocampus had contact with all available elements
A difference matrix, formed by subtracting the metabolic activity matrix of cortex contralateral to the stimulated eye from the ipsilateral "depressed" matrix, emphasized those parts of the visual cortex that received monocular visual input
In striate cortex, differences were maximal in the medial monocular portion, and the lateral or binocular portion was shown to be divided metabolically into a far lateral contralaterally dominant strip along the cortical representation of the vertical meridian, and a more medial region of patches of more or less contralaterally dominant binocular input
Lateral peristriate differences were less than those of striate cortex, and regions of greater and lesser monocular input could be distinguished
We did not detect differences between the two hemispheres in either anterior or medial peristriate areas, thus indicating either completely binocular input (which seems unlikely given the retinotopic organization of these regions), or a greater dependence than in the lateral peristriate on inputs that were not affected by the visual manipulations
7 in the entire lateral cervical nucleus(LCN) on one side of the cervical spinal cord, but this may have been an underestimation, as the penetration by the antisera was limited
More neurons in the medial than the lateral half, and more in the caudal than the rostral half of the hypothalamus project to the mesencephalon
In general, best elevations for afferents corresponded to hair cell orientations in the region innervated; unexpectedly low elevations obtained from afferents innervating the middle saccule may reflect curvature of the sensory epithelium against the otolith
Variation in terminal field sites also was noted in the medial to lateral axis of the descending octaval nucleus(dDON) ; however, there were no consistent correlations between terminal field locations, physiology, and best directions of the saccular afferents
In ventroposterolateral(VPL) of cats substance P(SP) fibers and terminals are present along its ventral and lateral border, a paralaminar area in which spinothalamic fibers have been shown to terminate and where neurons responsive to noxious stimuli have been reported
Also in rats the substance P(SP) innervation of ventroposterolateral(VPL) is similar to that of spinothalamic tract fibers
The presence of substance P(SP) -positive spinothalamic neurons in the spinal cord is reported in the following paper
The development of cytoarchitectural features of the medial geniculate body(MGB) was examined in rat to identify age-related patterns of growth in major geniculate compartments that have been described previously (Clerici and Coleman [1990] J
Golgi stains after birth reveal restricted dendritic arborizations in MGv cells and dichotomous branching patterns of MGd neurons
Somal growth occurs between all postnatal age groups tested for ovoid(OV) , LV, and deep dorsal(DD) nuclei, although LV segments related to high and low frequencies do not differ
Retrograde and transganglionic transport of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to the B-fragment of cholera toxin (B-HRP) was used to study the location, morphology, and central projections of mesencephalic trigeminal (Me5) neurons innervating rat masticatory muscles
Extensive central projections from labeled Me5 cells could be seen extending from the nucleus of Darkschewitsch rostrally to the C2 segment caudally
Despite the relatively unfeatured cytoarchitecture of the striatum, this large subcortical region has been found to have a modular macroscopic substructure comprising the neurochemically distinct striosomes and matrix, and, within the matrix, patchy input and output arrangements called matrisomes
We injected medium spiny neurons in lightly fixed slices of the squirrel monkey caudate nucleus, reconstructed their dendritic arbors, and analyzed the orientations of these arbors with respect to the cardinal planes of the striatum
We obtained comparable supplementary observations for the ferret caudate nucleus, suggesting that such spatial alignment of spiny dendritic arbors may be a general feature of striatal organization
The distribution of radiolabeled neurons in the brain stem of Lampetra fluviatilis was studied following unilateral injections of (3H)D-aspartate in the rostral spinal cord
After survival periods of 1-3 days, labeled perikarya were present within and nearby the posterior, middle, and anterior rhombencephalic reticular nuclei and in the mesencephalic reticular nucleus
In control Wistar rats, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide(PACAP) immunoreactivity was expressed in fibers in the superficial dorsal horn at all segmental levels examined (L1, L2, and L4-S1)
The density of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide(PACAP) immunoreactivity was increased in the superficial laminae (I-II) of the L1, L2, L6, and S1 spinal segments
In the squirrel, guinea pig, and hamster, mu and kappa binding is dense in the stratum lucidum of CA3 and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus
In the other species, the delta binding pattern is generally the inverse of the mu/kappa pattern: most areas of the hippocampus are enriched in delta sites, whereas the stratum lucidum and the pyramidal cell layer are receptor-sparse
While glucagon-immunoreactive amacrine cells were negative for substance P in central regions of the retina, a subset of this type of amacrine cell was immunoreactive for substance P in far peripheral regions of the retina
The projection of basilar pontine neurons to the cerebellar hemispheres was studied to pigmented rats by means of the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase
The main focus of labeled neurons following lobulus simplex injections of horseradish peroxidase was located in the ventral pons, at rostral levels
This pattern of labeling contrasts with that in cases of crus II injections, in which the main focus of labeled somata occupied more central regions of medial and ventral portions of the pons
Combining the latter finding with the preceeding notion regarding pontocerebellar divergence suggests a mechanism by which sensorimotor information might be transmitted to several different cerebellar locations
With light and electron microscopy, using mice, we studied the central branches of medial olivocochlear neurons that are given off to the inferior vestibular nucleus
These results indicate that the inferior vestibular nucleus is an integrating center for vestibular, auditory, and other types of information, but the results do not fit with current theories about the function of the olivocochlear system
Group A monkeys had horseradish peroxidase(HRP) injections or transcannular horseradish peroxidase(HRP) gel implants into the oculomotor complex (OMC), the largest of which involved adjacent paraoculomotor nuclei (e
Group B monkeys had injections/implants into the medial pontine tegmentum and dorsomedial basilar pons
The fastigial nucleus(FN) , basal interstitial nucleus(BIN) , and cell group Y, on the other hand, contained almost no labeling
These cases contained the largest numbers of labeled cells in the posterior interpositus nucleus(PIN) and a lesser number in the ventrolateral fastigial nucleus(FN) 
The so-called central nucleus also innervates the contralateral superior rectus muscle
Projections from frontal eye fields(FEF) terminated in ventral and caudal parts of the subthalamic nucleus without a clear topography
We observed that RL (retinal) terminals are largest, F (local, GABAergic, inhibitory) terminals are intermediate in size, and RS (cortical and brainstem) terminals are smallest
The terminal distribution of thalamic afferents in primate prefrontal cortex has never been examined in any detail
As expected on the basis of retrograde degeneration and transport studies, injections centered in the magnocellular ( mediodorsal nucleus(MD) mc) subnucleus of mediodorsal nucleus(MD) labeled cells and terminals in the ventral and medial prefrontal cortex
No terminal label was ever observed in layers I, II, superficial III, V, or VI in any part of the cerebral cortex following injections confined to any part of mediodorsal nucleus(MD) 
A previous study in the rat revealed that distinct orbital and medial prefrontal cortical (OMPFC) areas projected to specific columns of the midbrain periaqueductal gray region (PAG)
This study used anterograde tracing techniques to define projections to the hypothalamus arising from the same orbital and medial prefrontal cortical(OMPFC) regions
There were also projections to medial perifornical and lateral hypothalamic areas
The efferent axons of the inferior olivary neurons are already present and already highly organized in the cerebellum of newborn rats
Most of the autoradiographic labelling subsequent to the injection of 3H-leucine into the inferior olive is seen in the subcortical medullary zone
The principal olive, ventral and dorsal lamellae, supplies climbing fiber inputs to the hemispheric cortex
VGluT2 immunoreactivity was widely distributed in the forebrain, particularly in the diencephalon, from postnatal day 0 (P0) to adulthood, suggesting relatively early maturation of VGluT2-loaded glutamatergic axons
Interestingly, Vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGluT1) immunoreactivity was frequently colocalized with VGluT2 immunoreactivity at single axon terminal-like profiles in layer IV of the primary somatosensory area from P5 to P10 and in the ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus from postnatal day 0(P0) to P14
The present results indicate that VGluT2-loaded glutamatergic axons maturate earlier than Vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGluT1) -laden axons in the mouse telencephalic and diencephalic regions, and suggest that Vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGluT1) plays a transient developmental role in some glutamatergic systems that mainly use VGluT2 in the adulthood
By immunohistochemistry, both forms of the receptor were found to be predominantly expressed in cerebral cortex and dorsal hippocampus, in keeping with earlier radioligand binding and in situ hybridization data
Gangliosides were extracted, separated by thin layer chromatography, and quantitated in three cranial nerves of the garfish (Lepisosteus osseus): the completely unmyelinated olfactory nerve (OLF), and two nerves composed of both myelinated and unmyelinated fibers, viz
These results indicate that the ventroposterior thalamus is capable of substantial reorganization, which may account for much of the reorganization seen in somatosensory cortex
We report here that: 1) parabrachial(PB) neurons excited chiefly by noxious stimulation of the face have their dendritic tree located primarily within the field of lamina I trigeminal projections, i
, in parabrachial(PB) mid-extent, around the borderline between the external lateral and both the lateral crescent and the superior lateral subnuclei
Our results suggest the presence of an extensive excitatory axodendritic link between lamina I projections and parabrachial(PB) nociceptive neurons around the lateral crescent and the external medial subnuclei
This study investigates the distribution of brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein (BDNF) and its receptor, TrkB, during the development of hippocampus and cerebellum in a long-gestation species, the guinea pig
With advancing gestational age an increase in the intensity of brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein(BDNF) -IR in granule cells was accompanied by concomitant increases in the staining and areal growth of the associated mossy fiber layer in the hippocampus, and the molecular layer in the cerebellum
Thus, we have demonstrated in both the hippocampus and cerebellum that the spatiotemporal distribution of brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein(BDNF) -IR and TrkB-IR coincides with the maturation of granule cells prenatally and with significant periods of neuropil growth, both prenatally and in the immediate postnatal period
The thalamo-cortical projections are as follows: The small-celled mediodorsal cortex receives a projection from nucleus dorsolateralis anterior pars magnocellularis
The large-celled mediodorsal cortex receives projections from nucleus dorsolateralis anterior pars parvicellularis and pars magnocellularis
The lateral cortex receives a projection from nucleus dorsolateralis anterior pars magnocellularis
In the proximal part of the optic nerve, radial retinal lesions resulted in a sheet of degenerating axons along the rostrocaudal extent of the nerve
In the optic chiasm, the distribution of fibers was similar to that seen in the proximal part of the optic nerve
The ventral, nasal and temporal retinal fibers lay in the superficial part of the tract whereas the fibers from the nasal and temporal dorsal retina ran in the deeper, medial aspect of the tract
As the tract approached the tectum degenerating fibers from single retinal lesions did not always remain together
In the case of a lesion in the ventral nasal retina, degenerating fibers split into two bundles located at opposite ends of the tract only to reunite at their terminal regional at the caudal pole of the tectum
The organisation of the second visual area (V2) in marmoset monkeys was studied by means of extracellular recordings of responses to visual stimulation and examination of myelin- and cytochrome oxidase-stained sections
The total surface area of V2 is approximately 100 mm2, or about 50% of the surface area of V1 in the same individuals
Although fibers immunoreactive for calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) were identified in low density throughout the mediobasal hypothalamus, only female rats displayed prominent fiber staining in the periventricular region
Double-labelling immunofluorescence experiments revealed that the calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) -immunoreactive cells within the zona incerta, but not the hypothalamus, were also immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase; at least 60% of the A13 dopaminergic neurons co-express calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) 
These projections target the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus(IC) (CN inferior colliculus(IC) ) ipsilaterally and the inferior colliculus(IC) cortices bilaterally, with the ipsilateral component predominant
The ventral secondary cortex targets midbrain periaqueductal gray
The caudal cortex projection originates from smaller layer V pyramids and targets the inferior colliculus(IC) cortices with dense terminal fields
Ethanol exposure had no effect on neuronal size or choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) staining intensity of medial septal(MS) or DBv neurons when compared to chow-fed offspring
Each antennal lobe in the brain of a male moth has a distinctive neuropil structure, the macroglomerular complex (MGC), which is specialized for primary processing of information about the conspecific female sex-pheromone blend
Dendritic field sizes increase from 150 microm in the central retina to 300 microm in the retinal periphery
In rats of these three age groups, labelled neurons were found bilaterally in the red nucleus, with a contralateral predominance, and they were found in both the parvicellular and magnocellular portions of the red nucleus
Systematic charting also revealed smaller numbers of estrogen-concentrating cells in other specific hypothalamic and limbic locations
Pars intermedia and the posterior lobe were virtually unlabelled
In order to examine whether this limit was imposed by optic fibers or by target cells, optic synapses were counted in surgically halved tecta which received compressed optic projections consisting of regenerating optic fibers from the entire retina
The dorsolateral pontine tegmentum of the cat is known to contain enkephalinergic neurons, with most of the enkephalin co-contained in the catecholaminergic neurons; however, enkephalinergic cells projecting to the spinal cord have not been identified
A high concentration of these neurons was evident in the Kölliker-Fuse nucleus when compared to the nuclei locus coeruleus and subcoeruleus (P less than 
Both the enkephalinergic and catecholaminergic neurons projecting to the spinal cord were located in the same general areas of the dorsolateral pontine tegmentum and there was no significant difference in the mean diameters of these two neuronal types (P greater than 
The immunoreactivity for each marker was compared with the distribution of superimposed autoradiographic labeling of parabrachial afferents after unilateral injection of 3H-amino acids into the caudal portion of the medial nucleus of the solitary tract (m-NTS)
We conclude that in the rat parabrachial region, SPLI and NTLI are contained within two distinct populations of afferents which may originate from perikarya in the caudal medial nucleus of the solitary tract(m-NTS) , whereas enkephalinlike immunoreactivity(ELI) and the catecholamines are more likely to be found in other afferents or possibly in intrinsic neurons
We investigated the distribution and anatomical organization of glial cells in the antennal lobes and mushroom bodies of the honeybee
There are glial cells of different shape in the soma rind which are wrapped around the neuronal cell bodies of the antennal lobes and the Kenyon cells of the mushroom bodies
A layer of glial cells separates the mushroom body neuropile from the surrounding protocerebral neuropile
There is a high density of astrocyte-like glia in a column of the pedunculus which can be followed to the ventral part of the alpha-lobe
A network of mushroom body intrinsic glial cells separates the alpha-lobe from the beta-lobe and the pedunculus
The density of these axons reached levels that were higher than in any other part of the forebrain except for the striatum
The highest level of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -immunopositive profiles was seen in the basolateral nucleus and the second highest in the lateral part of the central nucleus
The lateral nucleus displayed a relatively low density of cholinergic innervation, and there were only rare choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive fibers in the medial nucleus
The cortical, accessory basal, and lateral nuclei displayed the most severe loss of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive profiles, whereas the basolateral, and especially the central, nuclei displayed relatively little change
In an effort to understand mammalian olfactory processing, we have been describing the responses to systematically different odorants in the glomerular layer of the main olfactory bulb of rats
) bly production of layers VIa, V, and IV occurs earlier in area 3 than in area 6
With respect to areas 3 and 6, area 4 shows an intermediate but significantly different t identify first generation neurons(i
One cc of cerebrospinal fluid was drawn through a needle inserted into the cisterna magna and mixed with 1 cc (4-9 million viable BCG organisms) of freeze-dried bacillus Calmette-Guerin
Viable BCG in the subarachnoid space produces a 3-fold increase in the free cell population of the leptomeninges in 24 hours and a 10-fold increase in 12 days
Finally, measurement of the cell diameters of neurons within the densely labeled areas in relay layers revealed that labeled and unlabeled neurons could not be distinguished on the basis of cell body size alone and that some of the smallest cells of the lateral geniculate nucleus(LGN) project to striate cortex
The type I terminals accounted for more than 70% of the total population of glutamate-enriched boutons in contact with dopaminergic cells in the dorsal and ventral tiers of the substantia nigra pars compacta as well as in the ventral tegmental area, whereas 5-20% of the glutamatergic synapses with dopaminergic neurons involved the two other types of terminals
Uncrossed and crossed projections were distinguished by cerebellar lesions placed on the side contralateral or ipsilateral to the tracer injections confined to the second and third cervical spinal segments (C2 and C3, respectively)
In the anterior interpositus nucleus, terminals were seen in the middle of the mediolateral extent, whereas, in the posterior interpositus nucleus, they were seen in lateral and caudal parts
The terminals of crossed projections from the cervical nucleus(CCN) were distributed ventrally in medial to ventrolateral parts of the middle subdivision of the medial nucleus
In the anterior interpositus nucleus, labeled terminals were seen mainly in rostromedial parts, whereas, in the posterior interpositus nucleus, they were seen in caudal and dorsal parts of the medial half
The present study suggests that the medial lamina VI group and the cervical nucleus(CCN) in the upper cervical segments project to the different areas of the cerebellar nuclei and are concerned with different functions
In the present study we examined the synaptology of the axon initial segments (AISs) of three populations of retrogradely labeled pyramidal cells: callosal, corticothalamic, and ipsilateral corticocortical projecting cells
Our results show that each population of efferent cells examined received a characteristic and rather homogeneous number (in comparison with the number of axosomatic synapses) of axoaxonic synapses: 16 to 23 for axon initial segments(AISs) of callosal cells, 22 to 28 for ipsilateral corticocortical cells, and 1 to 5 for corticothalamic cells
Within grafts of mesencephalic tissue located in the striatum tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) -positive neurons were distributed evenly at short times postimplantation (2-6 days)
On the other hand, no compartmentation and reinnervation of surrounding host tissue was observed for intrahypothalamic grafts of mesencephalic tissue or intrastriatal grafts of hypothalamic tissue
Western blotting of the nucleus, cytoplasm, and membrane subcellular fractions of the cerebellum and spinal cord tissues demonstrated that all three fractions contained Nogo-A
The thin lamina between the hippocampal hilus and granule cell layer, or subgranule zone (SGZ), is an area of active proliferation within the adult hippocampus known to generate new neurons throughout adult life
The central projections of afferent fibers from the cornea, and the infraorbital, infratrochlear, frontal, lacrimal and auriculotemporal nerves were investigated by means of the transganglionic transport of horseradish peroxidase
Afferent projections to the dorsal horn of the medulla are organized along both the rostrocaudal axis and the ventrolateral to dorsomedial margin of the medullary dorsal horn
An inverted but discontinuous facial representation exists through the restrocaudal axis of the dorsal horn of the medulla with perioral and nasal receptive fields innervated by the infratrochlear nerves represented rostral to the progressively more posterior receptive fields innervated by the frontal, lacrimal and auriculotemporal nerves, respectively
All nerves, including those innervating the cornea, project to the interpolar, oral and principal trigeminal nuclei and are somatotopically organized
Projections to the reticular formation and the contralateral trigeminal sensory complex were not found in this study
The retinal fibres, which initially project across the whole superior colliculus, withdraw from the caudal part and their terminals become clustered into deep, discrete clumps rostrally
We conclude that neuronal activity plays a role in the segregation of uncrossed terminals into discrete clumps in rostral colliculus and in the preferential elimination of uncrossed cells from the nasal retina
The normal ultrastructure of mossy fiber terminals within the ansiform lobule of the rat was investigated in parasagittal sections of the cerebellar cortex
Removal of the pontocerebellar input to the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere was performed electrolytically
Such lesions, when placed in the basilar pontine gray using a dorsal approach, resulted in the degeneration of nearly the entire population of mossy fiber varicosities within the contralateral ansiform lobule
This study explores the organisation and neurochemical nature of the projections from the zona incerta (ZI) to the basal ganglia
After zona incerta(ZI) injections, labelling was nonuniform across the different basal ganglia nuclei
Within the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus(PpT) , however, the bulk of labelling was limited to only one of the two sectors of the nucleus, namely, the pars dissipata ( pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus(PpT) d)
The pars compacta of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus(PpT) ( pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus(PpT) c) remained largely free of labelled profiles
In the ventral medial pallium(MP) of the salamander, neurons have mostly intratelencephalic projections
Spinal anterior horn neurons expressed galanin immunoreactivity, and immunopositive fibers were seen within the tract of Lissauer and the substantia gelatinosa
Similarly, galanin-immunoreactive perikarya and fibers were seen in the human locus coeruleus and subcoeruleus, whereas in monkeys these regions contained only fibers
Neurons in the ventrolateral medulla oblongata, a brain region implicated in central vasomotor regulation, have previously been reported to project to some forebrain limbic structures
Anterogradely labelled axons, ascending from the caudal ventrolateral medulla, could be traced only to the rostral aspects of the investigated forebrain limbic structures
The density of the ventrolateral medullary projections into all examined forebrain areas was low
The location of the cells in the ventral medulla oblongata which give rise to direct forebrain projections was examined using retrograde tract tracing with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP)
Following wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase(WGA-HRP) injections into the septo-accumbens region, retrogradely labelled cells were present in both the rostral and caudal ventrolateral medulla
The distribution of retrogradely labelled cells as well as the termination pattern of the anterogradely labelled terminals indicated that the innervation of the various forebrain limbic areas arises from cells, diffusely distributed in the rostral and/or the caudal ventrolateral medulla oblongata
The lateral motor column (LMC) in the anuran spinal cord normally undergoes a dramatic reduction in motor neuron number during development
Moreover, thyroxine-treated tadpoles contained increased numbers of mitotic figures in the ventricular zone of the spinal cord and significantly more newly generated cells in the lateral motor column(LMC) , as revealed by 3H-thymidine autoradiography
There was no evidence that nigral neurons project to the subthalamic nucleus
Nigrothalamic fibers arise particularly from cells in rostral and lateral parts of the substantia nigra
While some cells in other parts of the nigra project to thalamic nuclei, these appear scattered and less numerous
Large cells in caudal parts of the substantia nigra(SN) do not project to thalamic nuclei
No nigral efferent fibers project to any of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei
We examined the laminar and columnar arrangement of projections from different layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to the visual cortex in the cat
Injections of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase were made into the anterior "genu" of the lateral geniculate nucleus(LGN) , where isoelevation contours of the geniculate layers are distorted due to the curvature of the nucleus
Labeling from the A layers, which contain X and Y cells, was coextensive with layers 4 and 6 in both area 17 and area 18, as previously reported
There was also labeling in layer 5a and layer 1 in both area 17 and area 18
We found both differences and similarities in the spatiotemporal patterns of rod and cone development, which suggest the following: 1) Expression of opsin message (including rod opsin, blue and red cone opsins) was found in a ventral patch of retina located nasal to the choroid fissure
2) The cone mosaic pattern was generated by a crystallization-like process initiated in the precocial ventral patch and secondarily in nasal retina, which then swept like a wave into dorsotemporal retina
The accessory optic system of Rana pipiens consists of lateral and medial fascicles of the basal optic root (BOR1, BORm) and a single terminal nucleus, nBOR
Labeled cells could still be observed along the lateral ventricles, but very few were observed within the rostral migratory stream or subventricular zone
The cerebral cortex influences subcortical processing
The present studies evaluated how loss of cortical inputs affects sizes and plasticity of receptive fields(RFs) in the brainstem dorsal column nuclei (DCN) when peripheral inputs were normal and when peripheral inputs were acutely disrupted
Loss of cortical inputs was produced by acute lesion of somatosensory, motor, and adjacent cortex, whereas disruption of peripheral inputs was produced by cutaneous microinjection of lidocaine (LID)
Modest or no changes in sizes of dorsal column nuclei(DCN) receptive fields(RFs) , comparable to changes during control periods of no treatment, were seen in response to cortical lesion
lidocaine(LID) also caused rapid RF enlargements after cortical lesion, and these enlargements were greater than post- lidocaine(LID) enlargements when cortex was intact
These results indicate that normally sized receptive fields(RFs) continue to be produced in the dorsal column nuclei(DCN) after loss of cortical input
Cortex is also not required for RF enlargements after lidocaine(LID) ; however, cortical inputs have a constraining effect on these enlargements
Both individual and sex differences in the volume of the preoptic area and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus are determined primarily by incubation temperature, not by gonadal sex
In the nucleus accumbens septi, degenerating prefrontal cortical terminals synapsed on spiny dendrites which received convergent input from terminals containing peroxidase immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase, or from unlabeled terminals
In the ventral tegmental area, prefrontal cortical terminals labeled with immunoperoxidase for PHA-L were in synaptic contact with dendrites containing immunogold reaction product for tyrosine hydroxylase, or with unlabeled dendrites
This study provides the first ultrastructural basis for multiple sites of cellular interaction between prefrontal cortical efferents and mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons
Electrophysiological and anatomical observations suggest that terminals of olfactory bulb mitral cells ending in rat primary olfactory cortex exert certain postsynaptic effects via an excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter
corticotropin-releasing factor(CRF) -positive cells were seen within layer III of the olfactory tubercle and piriform cortex
Immunoreactive fibers and varicosities were also seen within olfactory-recipient regions of the amygdala and entorhinal cortex
A cochleotopic organization of the projections is apparent for cochlear nucleus and superior olivary complex
Two types of periventricular neurons were labeled by injections to the area pretectalis pars dorsalis(APd) 
Two types of periventricular neurons were labeled after injections to the torus semicircularis(TS) 
Projections of the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus are well known from the classical studies of Cajal (Ramon y Cajal, 1904) and Lorente de Nó (1933)
Projections from the entorhinal cortex to neocortical areas are less well understood
In the present study, a projection arising in layer V of the entorhinal cortex and terminating in a polymodal association area of the superior temporal gyrus has been identified with the use of retrograde tracing
Immunoreactivity for GluR 5/6/7 throughout the dendritic arbor of such neurons indicates that this class of glutamate receptor is in a position to play a prominent role in mediating excitatory neurotransmission within hippocampal-entorhinal circuits
The silver, Golgi rapid, and HRP material suggest that all, or at least the majority, of the granule cell axons project to the molecular layer of the dorsal cochlear nucleus(DCN) , forming parallel fibers similar to those of the cerebellar cortex
The border region between regio inferior and regio superior of the hippocampus (field CA2 of Lorente de No, '34) is especially heavily stained
Stratum lacunosum- moleculare is only lightly stained throughout much of the transverse extent of regio superior but there is also a conspicuous and constant patch of heavier staining at the border with the subiculum
We found that none of the tested viruses infected CA3 pyramidal neurons across synapses following inoculation into the CA1 area
After injections of viruses into the dentate gyrus/CA3 area, we found labeling in commissurally projecting mossy cells and their afferent granule cells but not in contralateral CA3 pyramidal cells
The remaining sensory relay nuclei and the nuclei interconnected with the motor and association cortex displayed a lower level of innervation
Immunoreactivity for nerve growth factor receptor(NGFr) was observed in cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain but not in cholinergic neurons of the upper brainstem
The contribution of basal forebrain afferents to the cholinergic innervation of the human thalamus was therefore studied with the aid of nerve growth factor receptor(NGFr) -immunoreactive axonal staining
These observations suggest that thalamic nuclei affiliated with limbic structures and with the ascending reticular activating system are likely to be under particularly intense cholinergic influence
The decrease in density from superficial to deep layers was more gradual in area 18 than in areas 17 and 19
Histochemical evidence for the correlation between the ontogenetic increases in cerebellar choline acetyltransferase(ChAc) activity and progressive mossy fiber innervation must await the application of the immunohistochemical method to the developing cerebellum
Retinal terminals in the pretectum were labelled by anterograde axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) after injecting the enzyme into one eye

Latency measurements to stimulation of the optic chiasm (OX) confirmed a monosynaptic W-cell projection to the direction-selective nucleus of the optic tract(NOT) cells and indicated a predominantly monosynaptic Y-cell projection to the jerk-neurons
Forelimb and hindlimb RNm are reciprocally connected with the caudal cuneate and gracile nuclei respectively
There is little or no input to RNm from the medial or lateral cerebellar nuclei
A few fibers from forelimb RNm project directly to motor neurons in the lower cervical cord
Forelimb and hindlimb RNm project to different regions of the lateral reticular nucleus with some overlap
We described the morphology of 27 different types of reticulospinal neurons found in the hindbrain 5 days after fertilization
A few cells were also located in the medial septum and in the vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band of Broca
Injections of the anterograde tracer biocytin in these three brainstem nuclei resulted in fibre labelling in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, consistent with the retrograde findings
In the adult brain, Neph1 and Neph2 are predominantly seen in the olfactory nerve layer and the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, in the hippocampus, and in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum
To a lesser extent, there is also synaptic localization of Neph1 within the stratum pyramidale of the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 region on both pre- and postsynaptic sites
The olfactory bulbs from Sprague-Dawley rats were processed using a Golgi technique that impregnated olfactory receptor neuron(ORN) axons
The hypothalamic and basal forebrain sites of synthesis of preprogalanin mRNA were identified in three adult monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) by in situ hybridisation performed with a radiolabelled cRNA probe transcribed from human preprogalanin cDNA
Moderate hybridisation was found in the periventricular nucleus and scattered hybridisation in the medial preoptic nucleus
The medial preoptic area and the anterior and lateral hypothalamic areas showed moderate to intense hybridisation in scattered cells
There was little labelling in the dorsal hypothalamic area but moderate labelling in the posterior hypothalamic area
The projections to the frontal cortex that originate from the various areas of the superior temporal region of the rhesus monkey were investigated with the autoradiographic technique
The temporofrontal fibers originating from the middle part of the superior temporal gyrus occupy the lower portion of the extreme capsule and lie just dorsal to the fibers of the uncinate fascicle
EphB2, EphB5, and ephrin-B1 are expressed in dorsal and ventral nucleus laminaris(NL) neuropil and at the midline of the brainstem at E10-E12
Galanin-like immunoreactive perikarya were seen in the telencephalon and mediobasal diencephalon
The hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARCN) was examined ultrastructurally 3 or 21 days after complete deafferentation of the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) in ovariectomized adult female rats
Immunoreactivity to somatostatin consisted of coarse fibre bundles that entered the dorsal horn at the nucleus proprius and radiated dorsally to the substantia gelatinosa
The distribution of immunoreactivity to met-enkephalin in the shovelnose ray was concentrated in the lateral third of the substantia gelatinosa and to a lesser extent in the nucleus proprius
The largest projection is to the ipsilateral nucleus of the optic tract and dorsal terminal nucleus (DTN) of the accessory optic system
Axons also run forward to traverse the lateral thalamus and to distribute to rostral portions of the nucleus of the optic tract in rat only
Further, this projection also supplies input to the medial nucleus of the periaqueductal gray matter, bilaterally in the rabbit and rat, and in the rabbit also to the ipsilateral superior and lateral vestibular nuclei
A fourth projection crosses the midline and courses caudally to reach, contralaterally, the dorsolateral division of the basilar pontine complex and the above nuclei of the vestibular complex
The projections of the cerebral cortex upon the septum in water snakes (Natrix sipedon) and garter snakes
Two cortical areas send major projections to the septum
Medial cortex projects bilaterally to the dorsal portion of the precommissural septum along its full rostrocaudal extent
Lateral cortex may send a sparse projection to the ipsilateral ventral septum
The climbing fiber inputs to Purkinje cells in zones 1 and 3 were derived from neurons in the ventrolateral outgrowth of the contralateral inferior olive, whereas those in zones 2 and 4 were derived from the contralateral caudal dorsal cap
The results suggest that the Eph system in the cochlea may have a role in maintaining cell segregation during phases of cochlear development
Far fewer cells were labeled by injections into the lateral medulla and/or pons
A small number of cells was retrogradely labeled by horseradish peroxidase(HRP) injections into the vermal and intermediate regions of the cerebellum or the periaqueductal gray matter
Thus, neurons around the central canal contribute strongly to long ascending spinal cord projections
We have analyzed the connections between the sensory trigeminal nuclei and two major sensorimotor areas (i
, the superior colliculus and crura I and II of the cerebellar cortex) in which tactile input from peri-oral and other facial regions is a prominent feature
Injections of either 3H-proline or horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the Svi reveal that trigeminocollicular axons reach the rostral two-thirds to three-quarters of the contralateral superior colliculus, where they distribute in a nonuniform, patchy manner within layers IV-VI
Data from a final set of retrograde tracing experiments show that the trigeminorecipient zone of the dorsal accessory(DAO) -PO contains neurons which project to crura I and/or II of the cerebellar cortex
Our purpose was to examine for the first time individual axon arbors from the pretectum that project to the lateral geniculate nucleus, describing their topography and nuclear and laminar targets
We made injections of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin into the cat pretectum, targeting the nucleus of the optic tract
Naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) have a large cortical representation of their behaviorally important front teeth, accounting for 30% of primary somatosensory cortex (SI)
The cortical representation of the retina in rabbits was studied autoradiographically using transneuronal transport of tritiated proline and tritiated fucose
The wedge-shaped internal nucleus composed of densely labeled calbindin D-28k(CB) + cells, separates the dorsal and ventral nuclei rostrally, and expands caudally to encapsulate the posterior MGV
The globus pallidus(GP) projects to multiple basal ganglia nuclei
One of the globus pallidus(GP) projection sites is the Str
Immunostaining for the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K (CaBP) was used to identify the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -poor sensorimotor and calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -rich associative Str regions and the corresponding calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -poor middle, calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -rich border, and the caudomedial globus pallidus(GP) regions
Cell counts revealed that the middle globus pallidus(GP) region contained a higher density of neurons and also a higher percentage of parvalbumin(PV) -positive neurons than the border and caudomedial regions of the globus pallidus(GP) 
Approximately 40% of neurons in the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -poor middle globus pallidus(GP) region project to the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -poor part of the dorsolateral Str
Approximately 30% of the neurons in both the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -rich border and the caudomedial globus pallidus(GP) regions project to the calcium binding protein calbindin-28K(CaBP) -rich Str region
It was estimated from the cell count data that most of the parvalbumin(PV) -negative neurons in all three regions of the globus pallidus(GP) project to the Str
The results indicate that the sensorimotor and associative territories of the Str have reciprocal projections between corresponding territories of the globus pallidus(GP) 
In muscoid flies, the lobula plate is the last station in the optic lobes for processing spectrally independent information from retinotopic afferents
Morphologically small-field efferents form three classes according to the origin of their axons and their arborization in the lobula plate and lobula
The possible functional significance of small-field lobula plate outputs onto descending neurons in the dorsal deutocerebrum is discussed
The ultrastructure and synaptic organization of the nucleus medialis and cerebellar crest of the teleost Chelon labrosus have been investigated
The nucleus medialis receives projections from the anterior and posterior lateral line nerves
In the dorsal region of the nucleus medialis, the perikarya and smooth primary dendrites of the crest cells are interspersed among myelinated fibers and nerve boutons
In wholemount retinas, immunoreactive cells were initially detected at the earliest stage of embryonic day 12 in a small circle termed "starting area" occupying the ventral part of the temporal retinal field
Closer examination using electron microscopy revealed that a significant number of subventricular zone(SVZ) astrocytes interpolated within the ependyma and established contact with the ventricle
In addition, subependymal, protuberant nests of cells, consisting primarily of neuroblasts, were found along the anterior subventricular zone(SVZ) of MRL mice
Retinal ganglion cells in fish and amphibians regenerate their axons after transection of the optic nerve
Fiber tracing studies during the third month of regeneration show that the axons have reestablished a basically normal fiber order in the two brachia of the optic tract; axons originating in the ventral hemiretina are concentrated in the dorsal brachium, axons from the dorsal hemiretina in the ventral brachium
In order to evaluate whether regenerating axons are capable of navigating in the optic tract and brachia and on the tectum, the present study examined the pathway choices and the morphology of regenerating axons en route to their tectal targets in goldfish
After a survival time of 18 to 72 hours (to allow for diffusion of DiI along the axons), the experimental animals were perfused with fixative and their right and left optic pathways (nerve, tract, and tectum) were dissected free and separated at the chiasm
Differences in the complexity of the growth cones of the regenerating axons (simple in the nerve and tectal fiber layer, complex in the tract and the synaptic layer of the tectum) provide further evidence for specific interactions between the regenerating axons and their substrates along the pathway
Tetraploid neurons in the telencephalon and hypothalamus increased their arbor lengths predominantly by increasing the number of dendritic branches, while maintaining the average distance between branch points in the dendritic segments
There are concomitant morphological and functional changes in the inner retina during the course of photoreceptor degeneration in a range of animal models of retina degeneration and in humans with eye disease
These dendrites had a major transverse orientation and were quite long, many of them reaching well into the dorsal and ventral horns and into the dorsal gray commissure
Cells classed as Type I had dendrites in lamina I and in the ventral horn but lacked a significant projection into the lateral funiculus
These cortical inputs were less reliant on the fornix
Laminar gradients of binding were observed that were specific for each radioligand; 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate(3H-QNB) sites were most dense in the inner molecular layer in all cortical regions, whereas 3H-flunitrazepam(3H-FLU) binding was generally most concentrated in the outer molecular layer and was least dense through all layers in the dorsomedial cortex
On the first two days after birth, GAP-43 immunostaining in the cortical plate was light and diffuse, then became intense in the presumptive layer IV of the parietal cortex on PND3 (day of birth = PND0)
We argue that the disjunctive expression of GAP-43 in the barrel field reflects the pattern of distribution of afferents (most likely from the ventro-basal thalamic nucleus) to the barrel field cortex, and that this pattern may be instructive in the formation of barrels as cytoarchitectonic units
The 27-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp27) is constitutively expressed in many neurons of the brainstem and spinal cord, is strongly induced in glial cells in response to ischemia, seizures, or spreading depression, and is selectively induced in neurons after axotomy
In addition, increases in Hsp27 immunoreactivity(Hsp27 IR) were detected in the ependyma and choroid plexus
Hyperthermia induced Hsp27 immunoreactivity(Hsp27 IR) in neurons of the subfornical organ and the area postrema within 3 hours and reached a maximum by 24 hours with a return to control levels 4-6 days after hyperthermia
The projection from the superior and inferior colliculi to the basilar pons in the rat was studied with the technique of orthograde transport of labeled amino acids and autoradiography
Pretectal nuclei project ipsilaterally to medial and lateral nuclei in the rostral and middle basilar pons, respectively
From 30 days onwards, the deposit of WGA-HRP resulted in a dense patch of retrogradely labelled retinal ganglion cells that could be seen to be appropriately positioned in nasal retina
Somewhat later, immunoreactive cells are detected in the posterior thalamic nucleus and in the rostral portion of the midbrain tegmentum, whereas the preoptic cell group is the last one to become tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) immunoreactive
The maturation of catecholamine(CA) neuronal structures in the olfactory and retinal circuitries, which takes place during development earlier in amphibians than in mammals, supports that notion
The majority of neurotensin-immunoreactivity was found at the level of subnucleus caudalis, where it was densest in the trigeminal extension of the lateral cervical nucleus
In five kittens, a unilateral visual cortex lesion was made on the day of birth, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was injected into the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian(PMLS) cortex of both hemispheres when the animals were 10
Quantitative estimates indicate that the number of labeled cells is much larger than normal in the C layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus(LGN) ipsilateral to a neonatal visual cortex lesion
Both types of neurons receive synaptic contacts from the afferent axons that ascend from the posterior colliculus and from those that descend from the auditory cortex
Cells projecting to dorsal (A-row) follicles were located in the most lateral part of the lateral subnucleus, while those supplying ventral (E-row) follicles were restricted to the medial part of the subnucleus
The pituitary develops from cells on the rostrodorsal portion of the head and reaches its final position, ventral to the hypothalamus, as the cephalic flexure occurs and the jaws and mouth form
The latter projection is similar to the diffuse cortical projections of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei in mammals
These findings support previous suggestions that the anterior dorsal ventricular ridge(ADVR) is comparable to sensory regions of the mammalian neocortex
Although efferents from both regions formed both symmetric and asymmetric synapses, NTS efferent terminals were statistically more likely to form asymmetric synapses than caudal ventrolateral medulla(CVL) efferent terminals
caudal ventrolateral medulla(CVL) efferent terminals were more likely to contact adrenergic somata than were NTS efferents, which usually contacted dendrites
These findings 1) support the hypothesis that a portion of NTS efferents to the rostral ventrolateral medulla(RVL) may be involved in sympathoexcitatory, e
This organization may have important functional properties with regard to a putative integration of different sensory modalities conveyed by thalamic afferent fibers to the anterior dorsal ventricular ridge(ADVR) 
We studied the topographic organization of thalamic projections upon different ranges of cortical frequency representation
Thalamic neurons were labeled by injecting horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or tritiated bovine serum albumin into auditory cortex
Injections in individual brains were confined to the same range of frequency representation, and distributed through three or four tonotopic cortical fields in order to label as much of the thalamic projection upon a limited range of frequency representation as practicable
The spatial organizations of arrays of labeled neurons are described, and each array is divided into a ventral division and lateral posterior complex (lateral part of the posterior thalamic group), both composed mainly of small cells; and a medial division, composed mainly of medium and large cells
The ventral and medial divisions (located laterally and medially within the medial geniculate body (MGB), respectively), both contact the lateral posterior complex which is located rostrally
The topographic organizations of the ventral division (and its tonotopic subdivision, the ventral nucleus), the lateral posterior complex (also tonotopically organized), and the medial division are described
In the lateral posterior complex, the low-frequency area is located rostrally, and the high-frequency area is located caudally adjoining the high-frequency area in the ventral nucleus
The topographic organizations of the ventral nucleus and lateral posterior complex are consistent with tonotopic maps of these regions
The earliest known marker for cells destined to form the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus(VMH) is the orphan nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), which can be detected in the hypothalamic primordium by E11
Most of these fibers appeared to end in the medial dorsal horn base, including the column of Clarke
The cuneate nucleus(Cun) projections from the different DRGs appeared to overlap, and the same was true for the projections to the external cuneate nucleus
Competition studies indicated that the Neuropeptide Y(NPY) receptors located in the deep cortical layers of the E21 or P1 rat cortex exhibit Y2 receptor type characteristics
Retinal projections and the degree of ocular segregation in the striate cortex were examined by transneuronal autoradiography following unilateral intraocular injections of 3H-proline in a New World primate, the spider monkey (Ateles ater)
The results show that, within the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), retinal fibers terminate in six principal layers and within the interlaminar spaces adjacent to the magnocellular layers, as well as the S layers ventral to the magnocellular layers
Our main result shows that, in the striate cortex, lateral geniculate nucleus(LGN) projections terminate in well-defined ocular dominance columns in layer IV
Unilateral iontophoretic deposition of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) into the suprachiasmatic nucleus(SCN) labeled ganglion cells bilaterally in the retinae
Notable diencephalic afferents included the dorsal lamina of the internal division of the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN); the ipsilateral input was twice that of the contralateral projection
The same region of the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus(vLGN) was also noted to be reciprocally connected to the contralateral ventral lateral geniculate nucleus(vLGN) 
The deafferented contralateral cortex was defined electrophysiologically, and quantitative estimates of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -immunoreactive fiber density were obtained from the forelimb and hindlimb sectors of area 3b in both hemispheres
In the 3b forelimb sector contralateral to the deafferentation, a decrease in density of choline acetyltransferase(ChAT) -positive fibers relative to the ipsilateral hemisphere was apparent at 2 weeks and most pronounced at 13 weeks, involving all cortical layers except layer I
From postmortem studies of eight human cervical spinal cords ranging in age from 11 to 35 weeks postconceptional age, we report that parvalbumin immunoreactivity is similarly plastic in human lower cervical spinal cord development, with many changes occurring prenatally
The proportions of diverging neurons in the afferent projections to areas 17 and 19, and to areas 18 and 19 were about 10%
Diverging neurons were also found in the projections of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei to the visual cortex
However, the immunoreactivities were observed in the accessory optic tract, fasciculus retroflexus, solitary tract, and primary afferent fibers in the superficial layers of the medullary and spinal dorsal horns
A prior retrograde tracing study revealed only a minor projection from the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing(HSD2) neurons directly to the central nucleus of the amygdala(CeA) , but these experiments suggested that a more substantial projection may be relayed through the parabrachial nucleus
Small injections of cholera toxin beta subunit (CTb) into the external lateral parabrachial subnucleus (PBel) produced both retrograde cell body labeling in the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing(HSD2) neurons and anterograde axonal labeling in the lateral subdivision of the central nucleus of the amygdala(CeA) 
Complementary cholera toxin beta subunit(CTb) injections, centered in the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing(HSD2) subregion of the nucleus of the solitary tract(NTS) , retrogradely labeled neurons in the medial central nucleus of the amygdala(CeA) 
The 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2-expressing(HSD2) neurons may represent one of the functional inputs to the lateral central nucleus of the amygdala(CeA) , and their activity may be modulated by a return projection from the medial central nucleus of the amygdala(CeA) 
The laminar origin of cortical projections to the frontal cortex was studied in 17 adult rhesus monkeys with the use of the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
Despite the fact that different regions of the central gray were injected in separate animals, the majority of the brainstem areas containing retrogradely filled neurons remained the same
No consistent differences were noted in the location of labeled neurons in either brainstem or spinal sites after dorsal vs
Electron microscopic studies confirmed the presence of mGluR7a in axon terminals in both the striatum and the globus pallidus(GP) and also revealed the presence of mGluR7a at postsynaptic sites in both of these regions
Retinal ganglion cells were studied in pigmented ferrets that received small electrophoretic injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) or optic tract
To determine whether any neurons that express the c-fos protein in response to noxious stimulation project to supraspinal sites, we combined the immunocytochemical localization of c-fos with the localization of a retrogradely transported protein-gold complex that was injected into the thalamic and brainstem targets of the major ascending spinal pathways
Using immunocytochemistry, we investigated the distribution of 12 major gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (A) receptor subunits (alpha1-5, beta1-3, gamma1-3, and delta) in the basal ganglia and associated limbic brain areas of the rat
In the substantia nigra pars compacta and in the ventral tegmental area, numerous presumptive dopaminergic neurons were labeled for subunits alpha3, gamma3, and/or delta
This highly heterogeneous distribution of individual gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (A) receptor subunits suggests the existence of differently assembled, and presumably also functionally different, gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (A) receptors within individual nuclei of the basal ganglia and associated limbic brain areas
The motor nucleus also receives an extensive bilateral input from the pontine and medullary reticular formation
Smaller, lateral reticular formation neurons were concentrated rostrally and ipsilaterally in the nucleus pontis lateralis
The findings suggest that the caudal medial cerebellar nucleus(MCN) in the rat, like the primate fastigial nucleus, is involved in the control of eye movement
The present study was conducted to examine the plasticity of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-immunoreactive terminals in the rat phrenic nucleus following an ipsilateral C2 spinal cord hemisection and 30-day survival period
In an attempt to study the morphology and distribution of Vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) + cells in the retina of the rhesus monkey in more detail, we subjected Vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) + cells observed in cryostat sections or wholemounts rhesus monkey retinae to a quantitative analysis
In terms of their type, laminar location, number, and targets, the synapses that formed the V2 projection to V3 A are typical of a major, excitatory, feedforward projection of macaque visual cortex
The efferent projection from the rostral cortices of the temporal lobe to the magnocellular division of the medial dorsal nucleus (MDmc) was studied in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta)
They make up the largest part of the temporal tip and separate the pyriform cortex from the architecturally more progressive isocortical divisions of the pole found laterally at the rostral ends of the superior and inferior temporal gyri
Intracortical injections restricted to lateral polar isocortex did not result in either anterograde or retrograde transport of label to magnocellular division of the medial dorsal nucleus(MDmc) 
In normal rats the crossed parabigeminotectal projection is restricted to the superficial layers in anterior and medial areas of colliculus, regions innervated also by the lower temporal portion of the ipsilateral retina
In unilaterally enucleated animals the crossed parabigeminotectal projection to the "denervated" colliculus is expanded, as is the retinal projection from the ipsilateral eye
In addition, there is a crossed parabigeminal projection to the "denervated" dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in these rats
The existence of an expanded parabigeminotectal projection in bilaterally enucleated rats shows that a sustained ipsilateral retinotectal projection is not necessary for the establishment of a crossed parabigeminotectal projection, but points to the possibility that ipsilateral retinal input may constrain the parabigeminal projection to terminate within certain boundaries
These findings suggest that cholinergic inputs to the ventral tegmental area(VTA) mediate complex synaptic actions, with a major portion of this effect likely to involve an excitatory influence on dopamine(DA) mesoaccumbens neurons
As such, the results suggest that natural and drug rewards operating through cholinergic afferents to the ventral tegmental area(VTA) have a direct synaptic link to the mesoaccumbens dopamine(DA) neurons that modulate approach behaviors
Second, the inner small-celled region is a group of small cells located between the external medullary lamina (ventrally) and the medial margin of the ventral regions of the main body of the reticular nucleus: the inner small-celled region is clearly differentiated in cats only
We suggest that the inner small-celled region may constitute a previously undescribed dorsal extension of the zona incerta, rather than a subdivision of the reticular nucleus
Each glomerulus consists of the highly branched neuritic arbors of both primary olfactory axons and antennal-lobe neurons, bounded by a nearly complete envelope of glial cells
Labeled Nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) -spinal neurons at the level of the decussation of the corticospinal tract were most numerous after tracer injections into the thoracic and upper lumbar cord
The main projections from the caudal Nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) involved motoneurons in the thoracic and upper-lumbar cord that supply abdominal wall and cremaster muscles
Nucleus retroambiguus(NRA) -spinal projections, especially those involving the upper lumbar cord, were sexually dimorphic, being more extensive in males than in females
This study determined which elements in caudal medial accessory subdivision of the inferior olive(cMAO) serve as the postsynaptic targets of the gracile projection and whether these elements also receive input from the lumbosacral spinal cord
This termination pattern contrasts markedly with that of other somatosensory inputs to the inferior olive and may account for the greater heterogeneity in responses to somatosensory stimuli displayed by neurons in caudal medial accessory subdivision of the inferior olive(cMAO) 
The most likely source of these inhibitory synapses is the parasolitary nucleus, a structure that has been shown by others to receive input from the cerebellum
Axons that form the adult uncrossed retinofugal projection arise from the temporal crescent of the retina and reach the optic chiasm on postnatal day 7
The abrupt divergence of the uncrossed fibres occurs at a border between two glial cell types: the interfascicular glia that characterise the main part of the optic nerve and the radial glia of the juxtachiasmatic part of the nerve
In order to investigate the expression of cell adhesion molecules in synapses, we have studied the localization of the neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM in the cerebellum and hippocampus of adult mice by immunocytological and immunochemical methods
N-CAM 180 does not appear to be differentially expressed in synapses of a particular morphological type, but is detectable in all types of synapses in the cerebellum and hippocampus, except for mossy fiber synapses and synapses between basket and Purkinje cells, which are generally N-CAM 180-negative
The present study describes the distribution and morphological characteristics of neurons and nerve fibers containing the catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, in the sheep brainstem and diencephalon on the basis of immunohistochemical procedures
Twenty-four to 48 hours after the nerves innervating different vibrissae were exposed to horseradish peroxidase(HRP) , the trigeminal ganglia, brainstem, and upper cervical spinal cord were fixed by perfusion and serial sections were processed according to the tetramethylbenzidine technique
The posterior vertical row is represented most superficially in the rostral nonlaminated nuclei, but most deeply in the laminated nucleus caudalis
Microinjections of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) were made in different mediolateral positions along the width of the pyramis and copula pyramidis
, the border between the pyramis and copula pyramidis, a different pattern of labeled cells is seen
Injections in this region resulted in the presence of labeled cells in four pontine areas, three caudal groups, and one group in the rostral pontine nuclei
Histochemical evidence is presented for a catecholamine-containing projection from the nucleus locus coeruleus to the neocortex in the squirrel monkey
After injection of horseradish peroxidase into the neocortex, labelled cell bodies are localized throughout the major portions of the locus coeruleus
Conversely, after microinjection into the nucleus locus coeruleus, tritiated proline is transported into the neocortex where it appears within fibers similar in distribution to those revealed by fluorescence histochemistry
Both transport techniques indicate that cortical projections of the locus coerculeus originate from both ipsilateral and contralateral nuclei
In this investigation, nucleus accumbens and extended amygdala outputs were compared by using retrograde tracing in adult and postnatal rats
Few neurons projecting from the caudomedial shell of the accumbens to the ventral tegmental area were observed even at postnatal day 21
All of the labeled neurons belonged to the medial olivocochlear(OC) system, and no lateral olivocochlear(OC) neurons were labeled
Several laboratories routinely reconstruct CA3 and CA1 dendrites to correlate their three-dimensional structure with biophysical, electrophysiological, and anatomical observables
A consistent fraction of parameters (11 of 30) was significantly different between CA3 and CA1 cells
CA3 and CA1 neurons could be distinguished by global quantities such as branch order and Sholl distance
In the mustached bat, we have discovered a population of such FM selective cells in an area interposed between the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC) and the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus (NLL)
To describe FM selectivity of neurons in the ICXv and to compare it to other midbrain nuclei, up- and down-sweeping linear FM stimuli were presented at different modulation rates
The main targets of anterograde transport were the deep layers of the superior colliculus and the suprageniculate division of the medial geniculate body
Sex differences were detected in most cortical regions with this sample size; the exception was the temporal cortex
On the basis of the resulting pattern of retrogradely labeled neurons in the cortex, different cortical areas and fields were defined
In contrast, the absence of sensorimotor corticopontine(SMP) plasticity after occipital(OC) lesions, and vice versa, demonstrates the absence of plasticity between pathways which differ anatomically and functionally
The projections from the pontine nuclei and the necleus reticularis tegmenti pontis (N
) onto the flocculus, uvula, and the paramedian lobule were studied with retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase n the rhesus monkey
The main findings are as follows: There is a conspicuous tendency for labeled cells to occur in numerous discrete clusters in the pontine nuclei after injections of these parts of the cerebellum
The flocculus appears to receive a substantial projection from the pontine nuclei
The flocculus receives a bilateral projection (slight contralateral preponderance) from medial and dorsomedial parts of the NRT
The number of labeled cells in the NRT was 13% of the number in the pontine nuclei
The cortical afferent connections of the amygdaloid complex of the cat have been studied by means of retrograde tracing of horseradish peroxidase and the fluorescent substances bisbenzimid and nuclear yellow
Fibers from the infralimbic area only reach the region of the medial central nucleus
From the earliest ages, visual cortical axons innervate the pontine nucleus in regions specific to their adult projection zones and show progressive growth within these zones
Within the retroorbital and retroocular connective tissue, the fibers redistribute to become associated with sensory-nerve branches of the trigeminal nerve, the orbital vasculature, and the periorbital sheath
Fibers reach their targets by traversing variable amounts of connective tissue of the periorbitum, the orbital septa, and the striated muscle epimysia
These fibers travel independent of the trochlear, abducens, and Vidian nerves, but, otherwise, they use the same orbital pathways as those employed in the intact animal
Golgi and axonal transport techniques have been used to examine the organization of neurons within primary visual cortex, area 17, of the cat
This organization has been compared to that of the primate cortical area 17 as described in previous studies and it is discussed in relationship to the distribution of afferents from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN)
However, lamina 4B in the monkey, which contains spiny stellate neurons but does not receive direct input from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus(dLGN) , has no direct counterpart in cat area 17
The retina continues to add new ganglion cells peripherally, but there is no neurogenesis in the tectum
To maintain retinotopy in postmetamorphic frogs, the terminals of the optic axons must continually shift toward the central tectum
We tested the proposal of centripetally shifting axons by making punctate injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the tectum of adult Rana pipiens and observing the patterns of filled cells in the contralateral retina, as was done in the goldfish (Easter and Stuermer, '84)
As the tectal site moves from rostral to caudal, this band of cells should move, pendulum-like, from temporal to nasal retina
Dorsally directed dendrites of both external urethral sphincter(EUS) and external anal sphincter(EAS) motoneurones coursed in lamina VII toward the intermediolateral nucleus, and dendrites of external anal sphincter(EAS) motoneurones further extended toward the intermediomedial nucleus
Our recent studies of tree shrew striate cortex have focused on the organization of lateral geniculate projections to layer IV and the projections from IV to layer III
Hypothalamic neurons were studied extensively, particularly in regions that are difficult to routinely stain with Golgi impregnations, including the arcuate, paraventricular, supraoptic, and suprachiasmatic nuclei
When Purkinje cells were deprived of their climbing fiber innervation by inferior cerebellar pedunculotomy or by transplantation of cerebellar anlagen into the anterior eye chamber, the subsequent patterning of INT beta 1-positive Purkinje cells was not changed
The lateral division of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEAl) and the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTov) have been linked closely anatomically and functionally
Although there was a similar overlap in the distribution of neurotensin(NT) with enkephalin(ENK) in the BSTov and central nucleus of the amygdala(CEAl) , it was observed that corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) and enkephalin(ENK) rarely were colocalized in either nucleus
), a stimulus that results in a robust increase in c-fos mRNA expression in the BSTov and central nucleus of the amygdala(CEAl) 
Furthermore, these data indicate that intraperitoneal interleukin-1beta(IL-1beta) recruits neurochemically distinct pathways within the BSTov and central nucleus of the amygdala(CEAl) , and it is suggested that this differential activation may mediate specific aspects of immune, limbic, and/or autonomic processes
Both the GR and the GA have the same cell components and glomeruli
Lesions of the nucleus corticalis produced degenerating terminals bilaterally in glomeruli in the corpus glomerulosum(CG) 
Following the destruction of the GR, degenerating terminals occurred in the ipsilateral lobus inferior
Both small and large cells in the ipsilateral corpus glomerulosum(CG) were labeled after horseradish peroxidase(HRP) injections into the lobus inferior
Examination of the motor columns in the spinal cord intumescences and of the third and twelfth cranial nerve nuclei revealed four neuron types, based on dendritic field size and dendritic branching pattern
Of the two types of gamma-motoneurons recognized in the spinal cord and oculomotor nucleus, one was a miniature version of the commoner type of alpha-motoneuron
An analysis of the relative density of label in the molecular layer of the fascia dentata suggests that the density of the commissural projection from CA4 is much greater in the rat and cat than in the guinea pig or rabbit
This pattern of projections suggests that extrastriate cortex contains a number of visual subdivisions in addition to MT
Contralateral projections were to MT and parietal-occipital cortex
Label in area 17 was concentrated in layers I, III, and VI whereas other cortical areas were most densely labeled in the granular and supragranular layers
The projection pattern to the superior and inferior pulvinar nuclei suggests that MT projects in a topographic manner to two subdivisions within each of these structures
The projections to inferotemporal cortex clearly distinguish the bordering cortex from MT
Subcortical targets were generally similar to those seen after MT injections, although additional projections were observed depending on the location of the injection
Thus, some of the cortical and thalamic subdivisions described for monkeys appear to exist in prosimians
Interhemispheric neocortical connections are widely distributed through the corpus callosum in the mouse
Further, superficial focal lesions in cortical areas which receive callosal connections give rise only to homotopic contralateral degeneration
Acallosal areas of 17 and 2 give rise to no callosal connections
The cells of origin of callosal connections are located at all laminar levels of the cortex and include pyramidal and polymorphic cells but not the granule cells of layer IV
In the spinal cord, labeling was most prominent in the superficial dorsal horn, motoneurons, and nuclei containing preganglionic autonomic neurons
Electron microscopic studies of the superficial dorsal horn and lateral motor column showed staining that was restricted mainly to postsynaptic densities and associated dendritic and cell body cytoplasm
Subsynaptic dense bodies (Taxi-bodies) were associated with some stained postsynaptic densities in both the superficial dorsal horn and lateral motor column
Presence of the decapeptide in the nervus terminalis prior to appearance of beta-luteinizing hormone(beta-LH) in the anterior pituitary suggests a possible role for luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) in this system on maturation of the gonadotropes and differentiation of the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis
To determine the distribution of terminating fibres in subnuclei of the heterogeneous paraventricular nucleus(PVN) , iontophoretic injections of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin were delivered into distinct areas of the lateral hypothalamic region
Neurons of the intermediate hypothalamic area projected mainly to the paraventricular nucleus(PVN) subnuclei, which contained parvicellular neuroendocrine cells
Finally, all areas of the lateral hypothalamic region contributed substantially to fibres terminating in the perinuclear shell of the paraventricular nucleus(PVN) 
Therefore, we combined peroxidase labeling of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) or Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) from the nucleus of the solitary tract(NTS) with gold-silver labeling for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the rostrolateral peri- Locus coeruleus(LC) region
Injections placed into neighboring nuclei (nucleus gracilis, hypoglossal nucleus) served as controls
Only injections centered in the nucleus of the solitary tract(NTS) produced anterograde labeling in peri- Locus coeruleus(LC) regions containing tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) processes
Approximately 19% of the biotinylated dextran amine(BDA) and Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin(PHA-L) axon terminals examined originating from the commissural portion of the nucleus of the solitary tract(NTS) formed synaptic specializations with dendrites exhibiting tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) immunoreactivity in the peri- Locus coeruleus(LC) 
In this study, we used image analysis to assess changes in calretinin immunoreactivity in the lateral (LSO) and medial (MSO) superior olivary nuclei in ferrets 2 months after unilateral cochlear ablations at 30-40 days of age, soon after hearing onset
In addition, the level of calretinin immunostaining ipsilaterally within neurons in the LSO was significantly less in cochlear ablated than control animals
Thus, cochlear-driven activity appears to affect calcium binding protein levels in both neuropil and neurons within the superior olivary complex
The efferent vestibular nuclei are located in the posterior medulla in and around the median longitudinal fasciculi (MLF)
There was a higher proportion of lateral cells that innervated the canal organs and the utricle while the dorsal cells tended to innervate the other organs
After transection of the optic nerve of adult rats, most of the axons in the proximal stump die and the surviving ones are unable to regenerate into the distal optic nerve
A punctate immunolabel was detected on somatic membranes of granule and stellate cell interneurons in both the eminentia granularis pars posterior and the electrosensory lateral line lobe
One of the telencephalic song control nuclei, robustus archistriatalis (RA), was examined in Golgi-stained tissue sections from the left and right hemispheres of male and female canaries
Retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase was used to examine the cells of origin of the callosal commissural fibers (CC neurons) in the primary motor cortex of normal and reeler mice
In the reeler mutant, CC neurons are found in all cortical layers, but two-thirds are situated in the lower half of the cortex
Reflexes at the lower levels provide rapid visceral and somatic reactions to threatening stimuli, while the periaqueductal gray(PAG) and hypothalamus coordinate these to produce more concerted responses
In particular, no evidence exists of direct connections between auditory and vocal motor pathways, and two newly identified centers for auditory processing, caudomedial neostriatum (Ncm) and caudomedial hyperstriatum ventrale (cmHV), have no documented place among known auditory circuits
Fetal day 77-135 monkeys all have a distribution and density of foveal S cones similar to adults, although the high-density ring is not obvious in fetal retinas
Especially for the latter two functions, periaqueductal gray(PAG) afferents from the lumbosacral cord are of vital importance because, in addition to information regarding homeostasis and thermoregulation, they convey information from the pelvic viscera and sex organs
In the present retro- and antero-grade tracing study, the projection patterns of different lumbosacral cell groups in the periaqueductal gray(PAG) were determined
The first and largest group was present in lumbar 7-sacral 3 segments (L7-S3) and consisted of small, oval, and fusiform neurons
The main midbrain target of the first group was the medial part of the lateral periaqueductal gray(PAG) 
This group projected strongly to a distinct region in the lateral part of the lateral periaqueductal gray(PAG) and the laterally adjacent tegmentum
Interruption of the vestibular nerve near the brainstem results in degeneration of all efferent terminals on outer hair cells
The hypothalamus showed a sixfold decrease in mGluR5 with development, whereas the cortex showed only a threefold decrease
The role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in homeostatic control in the brainstem, in particular, in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), is well established
The goal of the current study was to reexamine the efficacy of immunohistochemical localization of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) protein, specifically the 67-kDa isoform ( glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) 67), as a marker for gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic neurons in the medulla and to provide a detailed map of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) 67-immunoreactive (-ir) cells within rat nucleus tractus solitarius(NTS) by using a recently developed mouse monoclonal antibody
, this issue), and rubroolivary neurons were labeled retrogradely first with Fast Blue injected either into the cervical spinal cord or the inferior olive
Glutaeus axons were dispersed widely through spinal nerves 8 and 9 but loosely gathered together in one quadrant of the sciatic nerve after passing through the lumbar plexus
The major catecholamine(CA) innervation to the SON and paraventricular nuclei(PVN) did not coexist with the major distribution of magnocellular perikarya, but was located peripheral to the nuclei
The cortical projection of the nucleus submedius (Sm) was studied in the cat with the autoradiographic and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) methods
This cortical field is denoted the ventrolateral orbital cortex (VLO), consonant with previous nomenclature in the rat (Krettek and Price, '77a)
A light input to superficial layer 1 of ventrolateral orbital cortex(VLO) probably also arises from Smv(Sm) , and there may be an input to layers 5 and 6
All portions of ventrolateral orbital cortex(VLO) alpha appear to project to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray
The terminations of spinocervical tract fibers in the lateral cervical nucleus (LCN) of the cat were examined with anterogradely transported Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) in order to analyze their organization relative to the most medial part and the main body (the lateral two-thirds) of the lateral cervical nucleus(LCN) , which have differential projections and physiological characteristics
Deeper laminae of the dorsal horn contain moderate immunocytochemical labeling, but the ventral horn is only sparsely stained
Previous analysis of developing spinal cord has shown widespread, dense NT75 labeling throughout the spinal gray in the early postnatal period, which later becomes restricted to the adult pattern
Histological examination of brain revealed no striking abnormalities other than the loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells
A recent study, carried out in the monkey brain demonstrated a hitherto undescribed projection from the lateral to the basal nucleus of the amygdaloid complex
Injections of the lectin tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) were placed into several levels of the lateral nucleus and the distribution of fibers in the basal (basolateral) nucleus was evaluated
In general, the heaviest labeling of the basal nucleus was observed after injections at midrostrocaudal levels of the lateral nucleus, especially when the injection was located ventrally
Injections placed caudally in the lateral nucleus resulted in light to medium levels of labeled fibers in the basal nucleus; the terminal field in these cases did not extend as far rostrally as after the rostral and midlevel injections
After injection of tritiated gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) into the pigeon optic tectum and thalamus it was possible to correlate certain aspects of the autoradiographic labeling pattern with observations made from Golgi material
The first system derives from cell bodies within sublayer IIi the axons of which could be selectively labelled throughout their course within layer I and to the areas of termination within the pretectum and ventral thalamus
The radially ascending dendrites and axon collaterals of these neurons arbourised within sublayer IIf, and could be labelled in a retrograde fashion after tectal or thalamic injections
The biochemical and anatomical implications of specific gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) uptake and subsequent transport of label are discussed and a model of the tectal cortex, based on the three proposed inhibitory systems and their relation to a number of tectal afferent inputs, considered
The reeler mutation alters the radial but not the tangential structure of the neocortex, suggesting that these two aspects of cortical organization develop under the control of independent mechanisms
Ameboid microglia thus appear in the retina 11 days prior to the onset of axon loss in the optic nerve (about E23) and 14 days prior to the beginning of the period of reduction of retinal ganglion cell numbers (about E26)
Nine single axons projecting from area TE to areas TEO/PITd were reconstructed through serial sections
Thus, the authors conclude that, like other backward systems described to date, those from area TE to areas TEO/PITd are divergent
Comparisons to the ADVR of other reptiles are made, homologies to ectostriatial regions of the bird are proposed, and the findings are discussed in relation to telencephalic organization of other vertebrates
The present study examined survival- and growth-enhancing effects of cortical cells on basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) in culture and the degree to which endogenous nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) contribute to those trophic effects
When fetal (17 days of gestation) basal forebrain (BF) cells were grown for 5 days in coculture with cortical neurons, staining for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) showed a threefold increase in the number of BFCNs relative to BF cultures without cortex
We focused on two prominent sites of embryonic RA signaling: the dorsal spinal cord and the olfactory bulb
In the olfactory bulb, DR5-RARE transgene-expressing neurons are seen in the mature granule cell and periglomerular layers, as well as in cells in the subventricular zone of the forebrain-the established source for newly generated granule and periglomerular neurons
Some of these cells--particularly those in the spinal cord and olfactory bulb--are found in central nervous system regions that receive local RA signals early in development, and retain a significant amount of functional or structural plasticity in the adult
TN-GnRH cells, which are located in the transitional area between the olfactory bulb and the telencephalon, showed strong sGnRH and weaker cGnRH-II immunoreactivity
TN-GnRH cells projected to wide areas of the central nervous system from the olfactory bulb to the spinal cord
The second group, located in the preoptic area, showed only sGnRH immunoreactivity and projected only to the pituitary
This cell group projected mainly to brain regions posterior to the hypothalamus and the spinal cord
At the electron microscopic level, most immunopositive terminals in spinal cord and gracile nucleus displayed morphological characteristics of endings of myelinated primary afferents
There were several differences between RGS10-LIR distributions in rat and mouse, the most striking of which were the far denser immunoreactivity in rat dentate gyrus and dorsal raphe
Dual-labeling histochemistry in caudoputamen demonstrated that densely labeled striatal cells were biased to the indirect-projecting output pathway
ChAT+ fibers appeared to be rather evenly distributed throughout all layers of the motor cortex, but a subtle laminar pattern was evident in the somatic sensory cortex, where lower concentrations of fibers in layer IV contrasted with higher concentrations in layer V
Newly revealed is the extensive connectivity between the rostral subdivision of the dorsal nucleus raphe (rRpd) and candidate vocal nuclei
, anterior preoptic area to DTAM) were not confirmed
Dopamine (DA) influences a number of cognitive and motor functions that are mediated by the primate cerebral cortex, and the DA membrane transporter (DAT) is known to be a critical regulator of DA neurotransmission in subcortical structures in rodents
To gain insight into the possible functional role of cortical DAT, we compared the regional, laminar, and ultrastructural distribution of DAT immunoreactivity to that of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in DA synthesis, in the cerebral cortex of macaque monkeys
, posterior parietal cortex, dentate gyrus) not previously thought to receive a substantial DA input
For example, in contrast to TH, DAT immunoreactivity in the cortex was localized predominantly to small-diameter profiles, whereas, in the dorsolateral caudate nucleus, DAT and TH immunoreactivities were present in both large-diameter and small-diameter profiles, which may represent varicose and intervaricose axon segments, respectively
In particular, these observations reveal an anatomical substrate for a direct and potent influence of DA over neuronal activity in posterior parietal cortex and in certain regions of the temporal lobe
Moreover, this distribution of DAT suggests that cortical DA fibers may permit greater neurotransmitter diffusion than subcortical DA axons
ChAT-ir cells were restricted to the periventricular stratum of the optic tectum, but AChE-positive neurons were observed throughout the whole extension of the lamination except in the marginal stratum
The isthmic region showed abundant AChE-positive and ChAT-ir cells in the isthmic, secondary gustatory and superior reticular nucleus and in the nucleus lateralis valvulae
The peripheral axons also degenerated and this fiber loss exhibited selective topographies that paralleled the cell loss within the spiral ganglion, although this phenomenon was more prominent in the proximal part of the osseous spiral lamina near the ganglion and less obvious more distally near the habenula perforata
Glycine endings predominated in the ventral CN, while GLY/GABA endings were prevalent in the dorsal CN
This research shows that the medial preoptic area-anterior hypothalamus (MPOA-AH) of the gerbil contains a sexually dimorphic area (SDA) whose morphology is influenced by adult gonadal steroids
Coronal sections through the MPOA-AH were stained with thionin to visualize the SDA
