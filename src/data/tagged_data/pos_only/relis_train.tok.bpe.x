Labeling of sensory vagal projections was also found in the area post@@ re@@ ma of both sides and around neurons of the dm@@ n@@ X
The ventral striatum mediates goal @-@ directed behavior through limbic afferents
However , striatal regions caudal to the anterior commissure also receive inputs from the amygdala
Electron microscopic studies using combined anterograde tracing and pre- and post @-@ embedding immunogold labelling have shown that the pathways originating from the Ce@@ A to the NTS are inhibitory and may use GABA as a neurotransmitter
Here , descending inter@@ geniculate leaflet ( IG@@ L ) -@@ efferent pathways are identified with the anterograde tracer , Phaseolus vulgaris leuc@@ o@@ agglutinin , with projections to over 50 brain stem nuclei

Compar@@ able data for the pre@@ tectal ol@@ ivary nucleus ( P@@ ON ) show that this nucleus plays critical roles in the pupillary light reflex , light @-@ evoked blin@@ ks , rapid eye movement sleep triggering , and modulating subcortical nuclei involved in circadian rhythms
Our investigation shows that the primate striatum receives both direct and indirect projections from M1
Consistent with this , there are direct hippocampal projections to the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC )
However , the significance of the latter projection remains unclear because no data are available regarding the rh@@ inal targets of medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) axons

The anterograde tracer experiments indicate that projections from distinct cortical areas terminate primarily in individual longitudinal periaqueductal gray ( PAG ) columns
A previous study , in the primate , had demonstrated that distinct subgroups of prefrontal cortical ( PFC ) areas project to specific periaqueductal gray ( PAG ) columns
An@@ ter@@ ograde tracing experiments revealed that the projections to different periaqueductal gray ( PAG ) columns arose from specific prefrontal cortical ( PFC ) areas
As well , consistent with the retrograde data , projections arising from select orbital and agran@@ ular insular cortical areas terminated selectively in the v@@ l periaqueductal gray ( PAG )
Furthermore , by means of massive inputs from the ventral tegmental nucleus , the PM@@ d is in a position to integrate information from a neural system involved in spatial working memory , which may be of particular relevance for an effect of attentional mechanisms on the selection of appropriate escape strategies
Only area 4 projected to the magnocellular red nucleus , and this projection as small
The connections between the medial temporal cortical areas and CA1 of the hippocampus were examined in the Japanese monkey ( Macaca fusc@@ ata ) by means of retrograde and anterograde tract @-@ tracing methods with wheat germ agglutinin @-@ conjugated horseradish peroxidase ( WGA @-@ HRP ) and fluorescent dyes ( Fast Blue and Di@@ amid@@ ino Yellow )

Auditory information from the posterior thalamus reaches the lateral nucleus of the amygdala ( LA ) by way of two pathways : a direct thalam@@ o @-@ amygdala projection and a poly@@ synaptic thalam@@ o @-@ cortico @-@ amygdala projection
The retro@@ splen@@ i@@ oc@@ oll@@ icular connection is of interest because it constitutes one link between the limbic system , which is considered the anatomical substrate of emotional experience , and the superior colliculus ( SC ) , which mediates approach and avoidance behavior
Terminal fields originating in anterior and posterior regions of the retro@@ splen@@ ial cortex were preferentially distributed in later@@ odorsal and medi@@ o@@ ventral coll@@ icular regions , respectively , but there were also large , densely innervated regions in which the terminal fields overlapped

However , retrograde tracer injections into different regions of auditory cortex ( AI ) produced a normal pattern of labeling in the ventral division of the medial geniculate body ( medial geniculate body ( M@@ GB ) v )

Pro@@ jec@@ tions from the dorsomedial group of the principal olive to the dorsolateral hum@@ p were found to follow a basically ro@@ stro@@ caudal topography
The objectives of the study were to investigate this backward projection and to compare it with 1 ) the backward projections that have been described previously in the early sensory areas and 2 ) the forward projection from area TE@@ O to area TE
This excitatory input is most likely derived from axons that branch as they pass through the motor thalamus to the lateral hab@@ en@@ ula
A plausible hypothesis for reconc@@ iling this apparent discrepancy is that many Fos @-@ like immunoreactive ( FL@@ I ) neurons make local projections in r@@ N@@ ST , that in turn give rise to medullary reticular formation ( RF ) connections
In addition , vestibular primary afferents with bulb @-@ like enlarg@@ ements ( bul@@ bs ) in apparent contact with vestibul@@ ospinal neurons were trans@@ neur@@ onally labeled by bi@@ ocy@@ tin
This anatomical organization suggests that afferents carrying bulb @-@ like enlarg@@ ements ( bul@@ bs ) convey dynamic information to vestibul@@ ospinal neurons , which , in turn , project to the spinal cord networks
Previous reports using light microscopy have provided anatomical evidence that neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray ( PAG ) innervate the medial peric@@ o@@ erul@@ ear dendrites of noradrenergic neurons in the nucleus locus coeruleus ( LC )
The present study used anterograde tracing and electron microscopic analysis to provide more definitive evidence that neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray ( PAG ) form synapses with the somata or dendrites of noradrenergic locus coeruleus ( LC ) neurons
These results provide direct evidence for mon@@ osynaptic projections from neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray ( PAG ) to the extran@@ uclear dendrites of noradrenergic locus coeruleus ( LC ) neurons

The present study investigates the structure of the projections from the lateral and medial superior ol@@ ivary nuclei to the inferior colliculus at the electron microscopic level

The motor and sensory connections of the cervical vagus nerve and of its inferior ganglion ( no@@ dose ganglion ) have been traced in the medulla oblong@@ ata of 32 adult cats with the neuroanatomical methods of horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) histochemistry and amino acid autoradiography ( ARG )
The histochemical and autoradiographic experiments showed that the vagus nerve enters the medulla from its lateral aspect in multiple fasc@@ icles and that it contains three major compon@@ ent@@ s--@@ axons of preganglionic parasympathetic neurones , axons of skeletal motoneurons , and central processes of the sensory neurons in the no@@ dose ganglion

In unilaterally enucleated animals the crossed par@@ abig@@ emin@@ otec@@ tal projection to the &quot; denervated &quot; colliculus is expanded , as is the retinal projection from the ipsilateral eye
In addition , there is a crossed par@@ abig@@ eminal projection to the &quot; denervated &quot; dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in these rats
Lab@@ eled Nucle@@ us retro@@ ambigu@@ us ( N@@ RA ) -@@ spinal neurons at the level of the dec@@ us@@ sation of the corticospinal tract were most numerous after tracer injections into the thoracic and upper lumbar cord
The main projections from the caudal Nucle@@ us retro@@ ambigu@@ us ( N@@ RA ) involved motoneurons in the thoracic and upper @-@ lumbar cord that supply abdominal wall and cre@@ master muscles
Nucle@@ us retro@@ ambigu@@ us ( N@@ RA ) -@@ spinal projections , especially those involving the upper lumbar cord , were sexually dimorphic , being more extensive in males than in females
The most likely source of these inhibitory synapses is the paras@@ ol@@ itary nucleus , a structure that has been shown by others to receive input from the cerebellum
Histochemical evidence is presented for a catecholamine @-@ containing projection from the nucleus locus coeruleus to the neocortex in the squirrel monkey
After injection of horseradish peroxidase into the neocortex , labelled cell bodies are localized throughout the major portions of the locus coeruleus
Both transport techniques indicate that cortical projections of the locus co@@ er@@ cul@@ eus originate from both ipsilateral and contralateral nuclei
Few neurons projecting from the caud@@ omedial shell of the accumbens to the ventral tegmental area were observed even at postnatal day 21
The main findings are as follows : There is a conspicuous tendency for labeled cells to occur in numerous discrete clusters in the pontine nuclei after injections of these parts of the cerebellum
The floccul@@ us appears to receive a substantial projection from the pontine nuclei
The floccul@@ us receives a bilateral projection ( slight contralateral preponderance ) from medial and dorsomedial parts of the NRT
The cortical afferent connections of the amygdaloid complex of the cat have been studied by means of retrograde tracing of horseradish peroxidase and the fluorescent substances bis@@ benz@@ im@@ id and nuclear yellow
Fib@@ ers from the infr@@ alim@@ bic area only reach the region of the medial central nucleus
From the earliest ages , visual cortical axons innervate the pontine nucleus in regions specific to their adult projection zones and show progressive growth within these zones
Lesions of the nucleus cortic@@ alis produced degenerating terminals bilaterally in glomeruli in the corpus glomerul@@ osum ( CG )
Following the destruction of the GR , degenerating terminals occurred in the ipsilateral lob@@ us inferior
Both small and large cells in the ipsilateral corpus glomerul@@ osum ( CG ) were labeled after horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) injections into the lob@@ us inferior
An analysis of the relative density of label in the molecular layer of the fascia dent@@ ata suggests that the density of the commissural projection from CA@@ 4 is much greater in the rat and cat than in the guinea pig or rabbit
The projection pattern to the superior and inferior pul@@ vin@@ ar nuclei suggests that MT projects in a topographic manner to two subdivisions within each of these structures
Inter@@ hemispheric neocortical connections are widely distributed through the corpus callosum in the mouse
Further , superficial focal lesions in cortical areas which receive callosal connections give rise only to hom@@ otopic contralateral degeneration
Neurons of the intermediate hypothalamic area projected mainly to the paraventricular nucleus ( PVN ) sub@@ nuclei , which contained par@@ vic@@ ellular neuroendocrine cells
Finally , all areas of the lateral hypothalamic region contributed substantially to fibres terminating in the perinuclear shell of the paraventricular nucleus ( PVN )
Especially for the latter two functions , periaqueductal gray ( PAG ) afferents from the lumbosacral cord are of vital importance because , in addition to information regarding homeostasis and thermo@@ regulation , they convey information from the pelvic viscera and sex organs
The cortical projection of the nucleus sub@@ medi@@ us ( Sm ) was studied in the cat with the autoradiographic and horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) methods
A light input to superficial layer 1 of ventrolateral orbital cortex ( VL@@ O ) probably also arises from Sm@@ v ( Sm ) , and there may be an input to layers 5 and 6
All portions of ventrolateral orbital cortex ( VL@@ O ) alpha appear to project to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray
The termin@@ ations of sp@@ inoc@@ ervical tract fibers in the lateral cervical nucleus ( L@@ CN ) of the cat were examined with anter@@ ogr@@ ad@@ ely transported Phaseolus vulgaris leuc@@ o@@ agglutinin ( PHA @-@ L ) in order to analyze their organization relative to the most medial part and the main body ( the lateral two @-@ thirds ) of the lateral cervical nucleus ( L@@ CN ) , which have differential projections and physiological characteristics
In general , the heavi@@ est labeling of the basal nucleus was observed after injections at mid@@ ro@@ stro@@ caudal levels of the lateral nucleus , especially when the injection was located ventr@@ ally
Nine single axons projecting from area TE to areas TE@@ O / PI@@ T@@ d were reconstructed through serial sections
Newly revealed is the extensive connectivity between the rostral subdivision of the dorsal nucleus raphe ( r@@ R@@ p@@ d ) and candidate vocal nuclei
