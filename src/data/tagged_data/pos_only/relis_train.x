The results of these tracing experiments confirm the general notion of reciprocal connections between the subthalamic nucleus(STh) and pallidal areas
The nucleus accumbens sends a very sparse projection back to the medial subthalamic nucleus(STh) 
The projections of the medial subthalamic nucleus(STh) to the ventral mesencephalon appear also to be topographically organized
In addition, a number of subthalamic nucleus(STh) fibers reach the midbrain extrapyramidal area
The midbrain nucleus raphe dorsalis was the major site of origin for neurons providing a serotoninergic projection to the ventral posterolateral nucleus
The present results demonstrate that the Cparv fibers terminate in a localized fashion in both the striate and the extrastriate cortical areas and that these W-cell projections are quite unique in their areal and laminar organization compared with the X- and Y-cell systems
During the pharyngeal phase of the swallowing reflex, the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) receives peripheral inputs from the pharynx by means of the glossopharyngeal ganglion and is the location of premotor neurons for the pharyngeal (PH) motoneurons

Labeling of sensory vagal projections was also found in the area postrema of both sides and around neurons of the dmnX
The ventral striatum mediates goal-directed behavior through limbic afferents
However, striatal regions caudal to the anterior commissure also receive inputs from the amygdala
Electron microscopic studies using combined anterograde tracing and pre- and post-embedding immunogold labelling have shown that the pathways originating from the CeA to the NTS are inhibitory and may use GABA as a neurotransmitter
Here, descending intergeniculate leaflet(IGL) -efferent pathways are identified with the anterograde tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin, with projections to over 50 brain stem nuclei

Comparable data for the pretectal olivary nucleus(PON) show that this nucleus plays critical roles in the pupillary light reflex, light-evoked blinks, rapid eye movement sleep triggering, and modulating subcortical nuclei involved in circadian rhythms
Our investigation shows that the primate striatum receives both direct and indirect projections from M1
Consistent with this, there are direct hippocampal projections to the medial prefrontal cortex(mPFC) 
However, the significance of the latter projection remains unclear because no data are available regarding the rhinal targets of medial prefrontal cortex(mPFC) axons
These data suggest that functional interactions between dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and motor cortex might serve as a top-down control signal that inhibits inappropriate responding
A companion paper describes the thalamic connections of caudal medial auditory area(CM) (Hackett et al
Taken together, the findings indicate that caudal medial auditory area(CM) may receive somatosensory input from nearby areas along the fundus of the lateral sulcus

The anterograde tracer experiments indicate that projections from distinct cortical areas terminate primarily in individual longitudinal periaqueductal gray(PAG) columns
A previous study, in the primate, had demonstrated that distinct subgroups of prefrontal cortical(PFC) areas project to specific periaqueductal gray(PAG) columns
Anterograde tracing experiments revealed that the projections to different periaqueductal gray(PAG) columns arose from specific prefrontal cortical(PFC) areas
As well, consistent with the retrograde data, projections arising from select orbital and agranular insular cortical areas terminated selectively in the vl periaqueductal gray(PAG) 
Furthermore, by means of massive inputs from the ventral tegmental nucleus, the PMd is in a position to integrate information from a neural system involved in spatial working memory, which may be of particular relevance for an effect of attentional mechanisms on the selection of appropriate escape strategies
Only area 4 projected to the magnocellular red nucleus, and this projection as small

Auditory information from the posterior thalamus reaches the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) by way of two pathways: a direct thalamo-amygdala projection and a polysynaptic thalamo-cortico-amygdala projection
The retrospleniocollicular connection is of interest because it constitutes one link between the limbic system, which is considered the anatomical substrate of emotional experience, and the superior colliculus (SC), which mediates approach and avoidance behavior
Terminal fields originating in anterior and posterior regions of the retrosplenial cortex were preferentially distributed in laterodorsal and medioventral collicular regions, respectively, but there were also large, densely innervated regions in which the terminal fields overlapped
[Fluoro-Gold(FG) injections in the superior colliculus(SC) confirmed the retrospleniocollicular topography and demonstrated that this connection originated from layer V pyramidal cells of all retrosplenial areas

The objectives of the study were to investigate this backward projection and to compare it with 1) the backward projections that have been described previously in the early sensory areas and 2) the forward projection from area TEO to area TE
This excitatory input is most likely derived from axons that branch as they pass through the motor thalamus to the lateral habenula
A plausible hypothesis for reconciling this apparent discrepancy is that many Fos-like immunoreactive(FLI) neurons make local projections in rNST, that in turn give rise to medullary reticular formation (RF) connections
In addition, vestibular primary afferents with bulb-like enlargements(bulbs) in apparent contact with vestibulospinal neurons were transneuronally labeled by biocytin
This anatomical organization suggests that afferents carrying bulb-like enlargements(bulbs) convey dynamic information to vestibulospinal neurons, which, in turn, project to the spinal cord networks
Previous reports using light microscopy have provided anatomical evidence that neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (PAG) innervate the medial pericoerulear dendrites of noradrenergic neurons in the nucleus locus coeruleus (LC)
The present study used anterograde tracing and electron microscopic analysis to provide more definitive evidence that neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray(PAG) form synapses with the somata or dendrites of noradrenergic locus coeruleus(LC) neurons
These results provide direct evidence for monosynaptic projections from neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray(PAG) to the extranuclear dendrites of noradrenergic locus coeruleus(LC) neurons

Finally, the waist area of the parabrachial nucleus was densely labeled after cholera toxin-beta(CTb) injections in the parvicellular part of the ventral posterior thalamic nucleus
This suggests that oxytocin and vasopressin neurons within the supraoptic nucleus are stimulated at parturition via afferent inputs from the brainstem, but the input is not exclusively noradrenergic
mesencephalic command-associated nucleus(MCA) is part of the electromotor corollary discharge pathway, and its projection to ventroposterior nucleus(VP) suggests a feedback loop

The motor and sensory connections of the cervical vagus nerve and of its inferior ganglion (nodose ganglion) have been traced in the medulla oblongata of 32 adult cats with the neuroanatomical methods of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) histochemistry and amino acid autoradiography (ARG)
