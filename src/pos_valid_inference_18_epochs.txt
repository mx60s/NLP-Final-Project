Viewed broadly , BR1 posterior division cell groups share massive , topographically organized , bidirectional connections with the BR2 and other amygdalar components of the accessory olfactory system ( Dong et al , 2001a ; Dong and Swanson , 2004b ) , and they send massive , topographic projections to components of the hypothalamic behavior control column that are associated with the two basic classes of social behavior : reproductive and defensive ( Dong and Swanson , 2004b ) . learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between BR1 and BR2 exists .
In contrast , the BR1 anterolateral group receives massive inputs from the BR2 and main olfactory system components of the amygdala ( Dong et al , 2001a ) and sends dense projections to the central autonomic control network , to midbrain structures positioned to modulate the expression of orofacial and locomotor somatomotor responses , and to regions of the ventral striatopallidal system associated with these midbrain struc- BSTdm PROJECTIONS tures ( Dong et al , 2000 , 2001b , 2003 , 2004a ) . learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between BR1 and BR2 exists .

In contrast , the BR1 projections to the BR2 are found caudally and ventrally , where vasopressinergic neuronal cell bodies predominate , as well as rostrally and dorsally , where oxytocinergic cell bodies predominate . learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between BR1 and BR2 exists .
The BR1 also densely innervates several clusters of magnocellular neurons forming part of the accessory BR2 , where complex mixtures of oxytocinergic and vasopressinergic neurons may be found ( Peterson , 1966 ; Duan and Ju , 1998 ; Khan et al , 1999 ) . learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between BR1 and BR2 exists .

As in mammals , the cell group in birds is dopaminergic , is situated near the BR1 as it exits the BR2 , is rostromedial to and continuous with the SNc / A9 , and sends a massive dopaminergic projection to the basal ganglia , mainly to medial and ventral parts of the region that has been called the lobus parolfactorius ( LPO ; Lewis et al , 1981 ; Kitt and Brauth , 1986b , Bottjer , 1993 ; Reiner et al , 1994 ; Szekely et al , 1994 ) . learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between BR1 and LPO exists .

In both birds and mammals , the BR1 as a whole projects to the substantia nigra and the BR2 , with the projections arising from different populations of mediumsized neurons with heavily spiny dendrites ( Gerfen , 1988 , Graybiel , 1990 ; Reiner and Anderson , 1990 ; Reiner et al , 1998a ) . learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between substantia nigra and BR1 exists .
By contrast , the LPO of birds contains spiny neurons projecting to the substantia nigra but few ( if any ) that target the pallidal part of the dorsal basal ganglia , whereas the lateral BR1 ( paleostriatum augmentatum ) projects primarily to the dorsal BR2 ( Karten and Dubbeldam , 1973 ; Brauth et al , 1978 ; Reiner et al , 1983 ; Bottjer et al , 1989 ) . learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between paleostriatum augmentatum and substantia nigra exists .

Although Area X predominantly contains the cell types typical of the mammalian BR1 by physiology , dendritic morphology , and neurotransmitter features ( Grisham and Arnold , 1994 ; Luo and Perkel , 1999b ; Farries and Perkel , 2002b ) , it also contains a cell type that resembles a typical pallidal neuron in its aspiny morphology , its probable input from spiny striatal neurons , its GABAergic inhibitory projection to the BR2 , its neurochemistry , and its electrophysiology ( Bottjer et al , 1989 ; Luo and Perkel , 1999a , b ; Farries and Perkel , 2002b ; Reiner et al , 2004 ) . learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between Area X and BR1 exists .
Moreover , some developmental studies have suggested that ventrolateral parts of the chicken medial BR1 abutting the BR2 may ontogenetically be a pallidal territory that is heavily invaded by striatal cells during development and thereby becomes predominantly striatal in its cell @-@ type composition ( Puelles et al , 2000 ; Cobos et al , 2001a ) . learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between BR1 and BR2 exists .

The nucleus accumbens in mammals is a ventral striatal territory that surrounds the inferior margin of the lateral ventricle at levels well anterior to the anterior commissure and is cytoarchitectonically continuous with the overlying caudatoputamen ( ie , the dorsal BR1 ) and with the BR2 below it ( Heimer et al , 1985 , 1997 ) . learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between the nucleus accumbens and caudatoputamen exists .

By its cellular neurochemistry , the ventral 391 BR1 ( including BR2 ) also differs from the caudatoputamen . learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between BR1 and BR2 exists .
By contrast , SP co @-@ localization with enkephalin in spiny projection neurons is much more common in the ventral BR1 , including the BR2 ( Anderson and Reiner , 1990 ; Furuta et al , 2002 ) . learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between enkephalin and SP exists .
Thus , the region at the rostral ventromedial tip of medial BR1 in birds is comparable to the mammalian BR2 . learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between BR1 and BR2 exists .
For these reasons , the Forum recognized and recommended that the rostral ventromedial part of the former LPO of birds be called the BR1 and that the term medial BR2 only be used to refer to the remainder of the LPO ( Table 2 , Fig 6A , D ) . learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between the BR1 and BR2 exists .

The Forum thus recommended that the term BR1 be discontinued as the name for the region identified as accumbens in Karten and Hodos ( 1967 ) and that the lateral part of the bed nucleus of the BR2 be employed instead ( Table 2 , Figs 5C , D , F , 6B , C ) . learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between BR1 and BR2 exists .
The BR1 in birds appears to be at least partly represented by the hypothalamic part of the occipitomesencephalic tract , which courses medially from the archistriatum and taenia toward the lateral edge of the anterior commissure , before dividing into components that distribute to the BSTL and components that descend to the BR2 ( Zeier and Karten , 1971 ) . learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between BR1 and BR2 exists .

A second , independent argument for a basic dichotomy between BR1 and nuclei comes from extensive evidence &#91; 84 &#93; that most , if not all , cortical projection neurons ( pyramidal cells ) use glutamate as a fast , excitatory neurotransmitter , whereas in contrast the descending projections of two classic parts of the basal ganglia / BR2 ( the caudate nucleus / putamen and the globus pallidus ) use GABA as a fast , inhibitory neurotransmitter ( Fig 13 ) . learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between BR1 and nuclei exists .
One postulate of the model outlined here is that in general descending projections of the basal ganglia / BR1 use GABA as an inhibitory neurotransmitter , and descending projections of BR2 use glutamate as an excitatory neurotransmitter &#91; 206 , 226 , 295 &#93; . learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between BR2 and BR1 exists .

The descending projection to the brainstem / spinal cord motor system from the BR1 ( synonymous with neocortex , a term better left unused in light of unfounded evolutionary implications ; see Section 6 ) arises primarily from layer 5 , whereas the isocortical projection to BR2 arises predominantly from layer 6 ; cortical associational / commissural projections arise preferentially from supragranular layers 2 and 3 ( see Fig 13 . learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between BR1 and BR2 exists .

The oldest approach is based on the gross anatomy of the adult human brain , and it is easy to trace the first major breakthrough to Willis &#91; 332 &#93; , who in 1664 identified and named the corpus BR1 , which lay deep within the BR2 , surrounded by cortex and bounded caudally by our diencephalon . learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between BR1 and BR2 exists .

Although Risold et al ( 1997 ) cautiously suggested that ZI projections to RE essentially target only the rostral RE , we found that injections throughout the extent of RE produced strong retrograde labeling in ZI .

&quot; Notably , other sites with elevated fos were structures with significant input to RE ( mPFC , BR1 , AHN , VMH , and BR2 ; Fig 14 ) , suggesting that information related to various aspects of &quot; &quot; defense &quot; &quot; may be routed through RE . &quot; learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between BR1 and BR2 exists .

&quot; With respect to return SC projections to the forebrain ( or , specifically , SC input to the midline BR1 ) , Krout et al ( 2001 ) speculated that &quot; &quot; the SC @-@ thalamic pathway supplies sensory information to higher brain centers that participate in tasks such as escape , freezing and orientation responses , &quot; &quot; and , further , that these projections may transmit &quot; &quot; the spatial location and possibly the salience of unexpected events occurring in the external environment to cortical , striatal and amygdaloid sites . &quot; &quot; BR2 , LDT , PPN , MR , DR , LC , INC , NTS , and pontine and mesencephalic RF . &quot; learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the relation between SC and BR1 exists .
